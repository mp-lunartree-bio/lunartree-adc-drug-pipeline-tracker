A phase I study to test the effect of rovalpituzumab tesirine in the frontline treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (March 2020)  A Japanese multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation phase I study. This is the first study to assess the safety and tolerability as well as explore the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and antitumor activity of rovalpituzumab tesirine in Japanese participants with advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC). (update august 2018)  A phase I/II study is to assess the safety and tolerability of rovalpituzumab tesirine (SC16LD6.5) at different dose levels in patients with small cell lung cancer whose cancer has progressed or recurred following standard chemotherapy. Once a safe and tolerable dose is determined, the anti-cancer activity of SC16LD6.5 will be assessed by measuring the extent of tumor shrinkage. (update August 2018)  A phase I/II study is to assess the safety and efficacy of rovalpituzumab tesirine administered in combination with nivolumab or nivolumab and ipilimumab in participants with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC).(update July 2020).  A randomized, open-label, 2-arm, Phase III study is to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of rovalpituzumab tesirine versus topotecan in participants with advanced or metastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) with high levels of delta-like protein 3 (DLL3) and who have first disease progression during or following front-line platinum-based chemotherapy. (update February 2020)  A phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational, and multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy of rovalpituzumab tesirine as maintenance therapy following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. (update December 2019).  An open-label, Phase I, dose-escalation study to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RPTD), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of budigalimab. This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of budigalimab in combination with Rovalpituzumab Tesirine and budigalimab in combination with venetoclax.

Once a safe and tolerable dose is determined, the anti-cancer activity of SC16LD6.5 will be assessed by measuring the extent of tumor shrinkage. SC16LD6.5 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). The antibody (SC16) targets a protein that appears to be expressed on the surface of most small cell lung cancers that have been assessed using an immunohistochemical assay. The drug, D6.5, is a very potent form of chemotherapy, specifically a DNA-damaging agent, that is cell cycle independent. ADC's theoretically provide more precise delivery of chemotherapy to cancer cells, possibly improving effectiveness relative to toxicities.",

The antibody moiety of TRPH-222 binds to B-cell-specific CD22 receptors and is rapidly internalized, thereby delivering the payload intracellularly. Upon proteolytic cleavage, the maytansinoid payload binds to tubulin, disrupting microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics, inhibiting both cell division and tumor cell proliferation.   The site specific and stable conjugation to the payload allows for a higher drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) and an enhanced therapeutic index.",

          "Brief Summary": "This phase II trial evaluates whether loncastuximab tesirine and rituximab followed by dose-adjusted doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone works to treat patients with high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Loncastuximab tesirine is a monoclonal antibody called loncastuximab, linked to a drug called tesirine. It is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as CD19 receptors, and delivers tesirine to kill them. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs such as doxorubicin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair and may kill cancer cells. Prednisone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It is used to reduce inflammation and lower the body's immune response to help lessen the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. Giving loncastuximab tesirine and rituximab in combination with dose-adjusted doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone may be more effective at treating high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients than standard treatments.",

Monoclonal antibodies, such as brentuximab vedotin, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, prednisone, doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, and dacarbazine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. Giving brentuximab vedotin with combination chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells and reduce the need for radiation therapy.",

Inotuzumab ozogamicin is a monoclonal antibody, called inotuzumab, linked to a toxic agent called ozogamicin. Inotuzumab attaches to CD22 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers ozogamicin to kill them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving inotuzumab ozogamicin in combination with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells than with chemotherapy alone in treating patients with recurrent or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",

          "Brief Summary": "The purpose of this study is to test whether BV-AVD is an effective treatment in people with early stage, bulky Hodgkin lymphoma that was recently diagnosed and who have not yet received any treatments for their disease.\n\nBV is a type of drug called an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). ADCs are a substance made up of a monoclonal antibody chemically linked to a drug. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to fight infections and other possible harms to the body. The monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain types of cells, including cancer cells. The linked drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells. Researchers think BV may be an effective treatment for this type of cancer because the drug targets cells that have CD30, which play a role in cancer cell growth. By destroying these cells, BV may help slow or stop the growth of the cancer. AVD (doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) is a treatment regimen that works by stopping the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. The researchers think that BV in combination with AVD may work better than AVD alone to slow or stop the growth of the cancer.",

Before this study, PF-06688992 has never been given to people.\n\nPF-06688992 is a targeted therapy for people with cancer. The investigators linked a chemotherapy drug to an antibody (protein found in the blood). The antibody will connect to GD3 which is found on most melanomas but on very few other cells in the body. The investigators hope that in this way, it will deliver this chemotherapy directly to the melanoma and not to normal tissues.",

Loncastuximab tesirine is a monoclonal antibody called loncastuximab, linked to a drug called tesirine. It is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as CD19 receptors, and delivers tesirine to kill them. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs such as doxorubicin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair and may kill cancer cells. Prednisone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It is used to reduce inflammation and lower the body's immune response to help lessen the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. Giving loncastuximab tesirine and rituximab in combination with dose-adjusted doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone may be more effective at treating high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients than standard treatments.",

Monoclonal antibodies, such as brentuximab vedotin, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, prednisone, doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, and dacarbazine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. Giving brentuximab vedotin with combination chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells and reduce the need for radiation therapy.",

All participants will receive up to a total of 8 cycles of pembrolizumab (Q6 week dosing). The first cycle of pembrolizumab will be administered in combination with brentuximab vedotin (BV) (\"lead-in treatment\").\n\nFollowing lead-in treatment, all participants will undergo interim PET/CT (iPET) as well as fitness testing to help inform participant level of fitness for subsequent lymphoma-directed therapies.\n\nParticipants deemed \"non-fit\" by this assessment will continue 3 additional 6 week cycles of concurrent pembrolizumab and BV (\"induction therapy\", each cycle is 42 days), then continue single-agent pembrolizumab to complete up to 4 additional cycles (i.e., 8 total) of therapy (\"consolidation and maintenance therapy\", Non-Fit cohort). Two additional BV doses will be given as consolidation, at days 1 and 22 of pembrolizumab cycle 5.\n\nThose deemed \"fit\" after lead-in therapy (Fit cohort) will continue pembrolizumab and switch from BV to concurrently-administered combination chemotherapy using doxorubicin (A), vinblastine (V), and dacarbazine (D) for a total of 4 planned AVD cycles (3, 6-week pembrolizumab cycles, \"induction therapy\"). Chemotherapy drugs will be given at standard doses as in ABVD (no bleomycin will be given in this study) on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle (C1AVD), and pembrolizumab dosing will remain every 42 days. Following end-induction PET/CT, pembrolizumab will continue every 42 days for up to 4 cycles in the consolidation/maintenance phase. Two additional BV doses will be given as consolidation, at days 1 and 22 of pembrolizumab cycle 5.",

Inotuzumab ozogamicin is a monoclonal antibody, called inotuzumab, linked to a toxic agent called ozogamicin. Inotuzumab attaches to CD22 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers ozogamicin to kill them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving inotuzumab ozogamicin in combination with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells than with chemotherapy alone in treating patients with recurrent or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",

          "Brief Summary": "The purpose of this study is to test whether BV-AVD is an effective treatment in people with early stage, bulky Hodgkin lymphoma that was recently diagnosed and who have not yet received any treatments for their disease.\n\nBV is a type of drug called an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). ADCs are a substance made up of a monoclonal antibody chemically linked to a drug. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to fight infections and other possible harms to the body. The monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain types of cells, including cancer cells. The linked drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells. Researchers think BV may be an effective treatment for this type of cancer because the drug targets cells that have CD30, which play a role in cancer cell growth. By destroying these cells, BV may help slow or stop the growth of the cancer. AVD (doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) is a treatment regimen that works by stopping the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. The researchers think that BV in combination with AVD may work better than AVD alone to slow or stop the growth of the cancer.",

          "Study Status": "RECRUITING",
          "Brief Summary": "This phase II trial evaluates whether loncastuximab tesirine and rituximab followed by dose-adjusted doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone works to treat patients with high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Loncastuximab tesirine is a monoclonal antibody called loncastuximab, linked to a drug called tesirine. It is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as CD19 receptors, and delivers tesirine to kill them. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs such as doxorubicin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair and may kill cancer cells. Prednisone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It is used to reduce inflammation and lower the body's immune response to help lessen the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. Giving loncastuximab tesirine and rituximab in combination with dose-adjusted doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone may be more effective at treating high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients than standard treatments.",

Monoclonal antibodies, such as brentuximab vedotin, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, prednisone, doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, and dacarbazine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. Giving brentuximab vedotin with combination chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells and reduce the need for radiation therapy.",

It will also find out what side effects occur. A side effect is anything the drug does besides treating cancer. This study will have three parts (Parts A, B, and C).\n\nThe drugs used in Part A are a combination of targeted anticancer drug (brentuximab vedotin) and three chemotherapy drugs (doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine). These four drugs are called \"A+AVD.\" Participants will be treated with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) following every dose of A+AVD for 6 cycles of treatment (12 doses).\n\nPart A will look at whether the A+AVD drug combination reduces the number of participants who experience the side effect of febrile neutropenia. Febrile neutropenia is a very low white blood cell count and a fever, which can be life threatening.\n\nParts B and C will use drug combination of brentuximab vedotin, plus nivolumab, doxorubicin, and dacarbazine. These four drugs are called \"AN+AD.\" Parts B and C will study how well the drugs work to treat cHL and what side effects they cause.",

Inotuzumab attaches to CD22 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers ozogamicin to kill them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

ADCs are a substance made up of a monoclonal antibody chemically linked to a drug. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to fight infections and other possible harms to the body. The monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain types of cells, including cancer cells. The linked drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells. Researchers think BV may be an effective treatment for this type of cancer because the drug targets cells that have CD30, which play a role in cancer cell growth. By destroying these cells, BV may help slow or stop the growth of the cancer. AVD (doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) is a treatment regimen that works by stopping the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. The researchers think that BV in combination with AVD may work better than AVD alone to slow or stop the growth of the cancer.",

        "Brief Summary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate OBT076, which is a drug that combines an antibody with an anti-cancer drug. This class of drugs are called Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADC). Antibodies are normally produced in the human body by the immune system to fight infections but can be designed to target cancer cells and deliver an anti-cancer drug. OBT076 is composed of an antibody that targets the CD205 protein on cancer cells and delivers an anti-cancer drug which can kill them. OBT076 is an \"Investigational Drug\", which means that it is still being studied and has not yet been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or any other regulatory authorities to be prescribed by doctors for the treatment of metastatic or recurrent solid tumors. The use of OBT076 in this study is investigational.\n\nThis is a Phase I research study designed to look at several dose levels of the study drug to find the highest dose level that is safe and well-tolerated (does not cause unacceptable side effects), and to examine the effects of the study drug in a small group of research participants. The study will also look at the effectiveness of OBT076 as an anti-cancer therapy. Once the optimal dose is determined and safety is assessed, additional research participants will be treated at the optimal dose level to further evaluate safety and effectiveness.",

Following administration of PSMA-targeted tubulysin B-containing conjugate EC1169, the PSMA ligand specifically targets and binds to PSMA, a protein which is abundantly expressed on the surface of metastatic and hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells as well as on the neovasculature of many solid tumors. This allows for the specific delivery of TubBH to PSMA-expressing cancer cells. After internalization and cleavage, tubulysin B binds to tubulin and inhibits microtubule polymerization, which blocks cell division and results in G2/M phase arrest, tumor cell apoptosis and a decrease in PSMA-expressing tumor cells.",

          "Brief Summary": "The Glo-BNHL trial is trying to find better medicines for children and young people with B-cell non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL) that does not go away (refractory B-NHL) or does but comes back again (relapsed B-NHL). B-NHL is a type of cancer that develops inside or outside of lymph nodes (glands) and organs such as the liver or spleen. Examples of B-NHL are Burkitt Lymphoma and Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma, which may be other names used to describe this type of cancer. It is very difficult to cure relapsed or refractory B-NHL. The medicines used now are very powerful with many side effects and only cure around 30 in every 100 children treated. It is very important that investigators quickly find better medicines for these children and young people.\n\nThe Glo-BNHL trial will include three groups of children and young people, each given a new medicine (either alone or with chemotherapy). The investigators are looking to make sure the new medicines are safe and that they work to treat the cancer. If the medicine in one group does not work for a child in the trial, then they may be able to join a different group to have another new medicine.\n\nExperts from around the world will carefully pick the medicines most likely to be helpful to be part of the trial. If one of the new medicines seems not to be working as well as hoped then the investigators will take it out of the trial as soon as possible. This will let other new medicines be added to the trial and tested. If a medicine does seem to be working well, then it will continue in the trial to make sure it really is the most useful medicine available.\n\nChildren from around the world will be invited to take part in the trial. The investigators will then check on them for at least two years after they finish the trial treatment to look for possible side effects of the new medicine.",

The linker technology allows for the development of novel  more homogeneous (generally DAR > 4) ADCs. The technology uses bis-sulfone reagents selective for cysteine sulfur atoms from a native disulfide bond. Antibody interchain disulfides are selectively reduced, and the reagent undergoes bis-alkylation to conjugate both thiols derived from the two cysteine residues of the reduced disulfides. This results in covalent rebridging of the disulfide bond by means of a three carbon bridge, leaving the protein structurally intact. The active cytotoxic agent is attached to the bis-alkylating linker through a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain to produce the reagent (Thiobridge technology) for conjugation.",

          "Brief Summary": "HER2 positive breast cancer cells have more HER2 receptor (a protein on the surface of cells) than normal breast cells. Approximately 30% of patients with breast cancer have HER2 positive breast cancer. Before HER2 targeted therapies (i.e. treatments that directly block the receptor HER2) were developed, patients with HER2 positive breast cancer had a very aggressive form of disease. With the use of trastuzumab, an anticancer drug that directly targets the receptor HER2, and more recently, pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine, patients are able to live longer and have better control of their cancer.\n\nUnfortunately the use of HER2 targeted therapies can increase the risk of heart problems and for this reason these treatments were only studied and approved for patients with normal heart function.\n\nIn this study we plan to give HER2 targeted therapies to patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function along with concomitant evaluation by a heart doctor (called cardiologist) and appropriate medications to strengthen the heart. We will do frequent monitoring of the heart function with a test called echocardiogram that will give us a detailed \"picture\" of the heart. We will also draw blood along with routine blood tests to try to understand why some patients develop heart problems and others do not. The study will take a maximum of 12 months and patients will be monitored for 6 additional months.\n\nWe hypothesize that it is safe to administer HER2 targeted therapies to patients with breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function, i.e. LVEF between 40 and 50%, while on appropriate heart medications.",

This drug has been used in laboratory experiments and information from these studies suggests that this drug may help to prevent or slow the growth of cancer cells. The main purpose of this study is to find the appropriate dose of Taselisib to be used with other drugs in further clinical studies. This is an open-label, 3+3 dose-escalation phase Ib study to identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose(s) (MTD) and to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Taselisib.

The FGF/FGFR signaling pathway has been shown to mediate cell proliferation, migration, motility, and survival. Autophosphorylation of FGFR is required for activation of FGF-induced downstream signaling. The aberrant regulation of this pathway has been implicated in many forms of human malignancies. It has also been determined that activation of the FGF/FGFR pathway may lead to increased tumor angiogenesis and play a role in tumor resistance to antiangiogenic agents and other chemotherapies.",

The principal toxic effects were maculopapular rashes, focal blister formation, and skin exfoliation.  Tijink BM, et al. (2006 Clin. Cancer Res.) reported skin toxicity. The development of bivatuzumab mertansine was discontinued due to the occurrence of skin toxicity in Phase I clinical trials in patients with advanced carcinoma. In addition to its expression on various carcinomas, including squamous cell carcinomas and a proportion of adenocarcinomas, published data indicate that CD44v6  also is expressed on normal proliferating epidermal skin cells."

          "Brief Summary": "This phase II trial evaluates whether loncastuximab tesirine and rituximab followed by dose-adjusted doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone works to treat patients with high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Loncastuximab tesirine is a monoclonal antibody called loncastuximab, linked to a drug called tesirine. It is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as CD19 receptors, and delivers tesirine to kill them. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs such as doxorubicin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair and may kill cancer cells. Prednisone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It is used to reduce inflammation and lower the body's immune response to help lessen the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. Giving loncastuximab tesirine and rituximab in combination with dose-adjusted doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone may be more effective at treating high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients than standard treatments.",

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, prednisone, doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, and dacarbazine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. Giving brentuximab vedotin with combination chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells and reduce the need for radiation therapy.",

Inotuzumab ozogamicin is a monoclonal antibody, called inotuzumab, linked to a toxic agent called ozogamicin. Inotuzumab attaches to CD22 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers ozogamicin to kill them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving inotuzumab ozogamicin in combination with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells than with chemotherapy alone in treating patients with recurrent or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",

          "Brief Summary": "The purpose of this study is to test whether BV-AVD is an effective treatment in people with early stage, bulky Hodgkin lymphoma that was recently diagnosed and who have not yet received any treatments for their disease.\n\nBV is a type of drug called an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). ADCs are a substance made up of a monoclonal antibody chemically linked to a drug. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to fight infections and other possible harms to the body. The monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain types of cells, including cancer cells. The linked drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells. Researchers think BV may be an effective treatment for this type of cancer because the drug targets cells that have CD30, which play a role in cancer cell growth. By destroying these cells, BV may help slow or stop the growth of the cancer. AVD (doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) is a treatment regimen that works by stopping the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. The researchers think that BV in combination with AVD may work better than AVD alone to slow or stop the growth of the cancer.",

In cholangiocarinoma and adenocarinoma of the pancreas, 3-weekly anetumab ravtansine is administered in combination with cisplatin or gemcitabine respectively (both administered in a 2 week on / 1 week off schedule).\n\nTreatment will continue until disease progression or until another criterion for withdrawal is met. .Efficacy will be measured by evaluating the tumor's objective response rate. Radiological tumor assessments will be performed at defined time points until the patient's disease progresses.\n\nBlood samples will be collected for safety, pharmacokinetic and biomarker analysis. Archival or fresh biopsy tissue will also be collected for mesothelin expression testing and biomarker analyses.",

DESCRIPTION Inotuzumab ozogamicin is a CD22-directed antibody and cytotoxic-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of 3 components: 1) the recombinant humanized immunoglobulin class G subtype 4 (IgG4) kappa antibody inotuzumab, specific for human CD22, 2) N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin that causes double-stranded DNA breaks, and 3) an acid-cleavable linker composed of the condensation product of 4-(4'-acetylphenoxy)-butanoic acid (AcBut) and 3-methyl-3-mercaptobutane hydrazide (known as dimethylhydrazide) that covalently attaches N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin to inotuzumab. Inotuzumab ozogamicin has an approximate molecular weight of 160 kDa. The average number of calicheamicin derivative molecules conjugated to each inotuzumab molecule is approximately 6 with a distribution from 2\u20138. Inotuzumab ozogamicin is produced by chemical conjugation of the antibody and small molecule components. The antibody is produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, and the semisynthetic calicheamicin derivative is produced by microbial fermentation followed by synthetic modification. BESPONSA (inotuzumab ozogamicin) for injection is supplied as a sterile, white to off-white, preservative-free, lyophilized powder for intravenous administration. Each single-dose vial delivers 0.9 mg inotuzumab ozogamicin. Inactive ingredients are polysorbate 80 (0.36 mg), sodium chloride (2.16 mg), sucrose (180 mg), and tromethamine (8.64 mg). After reconstitution with 4 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, the final concentration is 0.25 mg/mL of inotuzumab ozogamicin with a deliverable volume of 3.6 mL (0.9 mg) and a pH of approximately 8.0.

          "Brief Summary": "This trial is a limited multi-center, Phase II study to evaluate inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa) in pediatric patients with MRD positive CD22-positive B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).\n\nSome patients with newly diagnosed ALL maintain low levels of MRD, despite achieving complete remission with less than 5% blasts in the bone marrow. Others experience re-emergence of low level MRD or increasing levels of MRD on therapy or post-transplant. New approaches are needed to achieve undetectable MRD in these high-risk patients.\n\nInotuzumab ozogamicin is an antibody-drug conjugate composed of a humanized IgG subtype 4 monoclonal CD22-targeted antibody linked to calicheamicin, a potent anti-tumor antibiotic. CD22 is expressed in more than 90% of patients with B-cell ALL, making it an attractive target in this patient population. Inotuzumab ozogamicin has demonstrated exceptional activity in adults with relapsed or refractory B-ALL.\n\nPrimary Objective\n\n* Assess the efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients with MRD positive CD22+ B-ALL with 0.1 - 4.99% blasts in bone marrow.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\n* Study the safety of inotuzumab ozogamicin when used in patients with MRD - positive CD22+ B-ALL with \\< 5 % blasts in bone marrow.\n* Estimate the incidence, severity, and outcome of hepatotoxicity and sinusoidal obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease (SOS/VOD) in patients during inotuzumab ozogamicin and following subsequent treatment, including hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).",

Inotuzumab ozogamicin is a monoclonal antibody, called inotuzumab, linked to a toxic agent called ozogamicin. Inotuzumab attaches to CD22 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers ozogamicin to kill them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving inotuzumab ozogamicin in combination with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells than with chemotherapy alone in treating patients with recurrent or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",

B-NHL is a type of cancer that develops inside or outside of lymph nodes (glands) and organs such as the liver or spleen. Examples of B-NHL are Burkitt Lymphoma and Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma, which may be other names used to describe this type of cancer. It is very difficult to cure relapsed or refractory B-NHL. The medicines used now are very powerful with many side effects and only cure around 30 in every 100 children treated. It is very important that investigators quickly find better medicines for these children and young people.\n\nThe Glo-BNHL trial will include three groups of children and young people, each given a new medicine (either alone or with chemotherapy). The investigators are looking to make sure the new medicines are safe and that they work to treat the cancer. If the medicine in one group does not work for a child in the trial, then they may be able to join a different group to have another new medicine.\n\nExperts from around the world will carefully pick the medicines most likely to be helpful to be part of the trial. If one of the new medicines seems not to be working as well as hoped then the investigators will take it out of the trial as soon as possible. This will let other new medicines be added to the trial and tested. If a medicine does seem to be working well, then it will continue in the trial to make sure it really is the most useful medicine available.\n\nChildren from around the world will be invited to take part in the trial. The investigators will then check on them for at least two years after they finish the trial treatment to look for possible side effects of the new medicine.",

Salvage therapy (treatment after standard treatment failed) needs to be improved. Rituximab, gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin combination is a standard therapy for rrDLBCL and polatuzumab vedotin (PV) is a novel antibody-drug conjugate targeting CD79b. PV has shown efficacy in the setting of rrDLBCL and can improve the response rates of standard salvage therapy.\n\nThis study will focus on subjects in the first relapse (one prior regimen) and will include both subjects who are transplant eligible and those who are transplant ineligible.",

The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of epcoritamab in combination with anti-neoplastic agents in adult participants with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Adverse events and change in disease activity will be assessed.\n\nEpcoritamab is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of NHL. Study doctors put the participants in groups called treatment arms. The combination of epcoritamab with anti-neoplastic agents will be explored. Each treatment arm receives a different treatment combination depending on eligibility. Approximately 394 adult participants with NHL will be enrolled in 100 sites globally.\n\nIn both the dose escalation and dose expansion arms participants will receive subcutaneous (SC) epcoritamab in 28-day or 21 day cycles dependent on the arm in combination with the anti-neoplastic agents described below:\n\n1: Oral lenalidomide in participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL); 2: Oral ibrutinib and oral lenalidomide in participants with with R/R DLBCL; 3: Intravenous (IV) polatuzumab vedotin, IV rituximab, IV cyclophosphamide, IV doxorubicin hydrochloride (HCl), and oral prednisone (pola-R-CHP) in participants with newly diagnosed treatment-na\u00efve DLBCL; 4: Oral CC-99282 in participants with R/R DLBCL; 5: Oral CC-99282 in participants with R/R follicular lymphoma (FL); 6A: Oral ibrutinib in participants with R/R mantle cell lymphoma (MCL); 6B: Oral ibrutinib, and oral venetoclax in participants with R/R MCL; 7: Oral ibrutinib, and oral venetoclax in participants with newly diagnosed treatment-na\u00efve MCL.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at an approved institution (hospital or clinic). The effect of the treatment will be frequently checked by medical assessments, blood tests, questionnaires and side effects.",

        "description": "[\"11 DESCRIPTION Polatuzumab vedotin-piiq is a CD79b-directed antibody and microtubule inhibitor conjugate. It consists of three components: 1) the humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody specific for human CD79b; 2) the small molecule anti-mitotic agent MMAE; and 3) a protease-cleavable linker maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (mc-vc-PAB) that covalently attaches MMAE to the polatuzumab antibody. Polatuzumab vedotin-piiq has an approximate molecular weight of 150 kDa. An average of 3.5 molecules of MMAE are attached to each antibody molecule. Polatuzumab vedotin-piiq is produced by chemical conjugation of the antibody and small molecule components. The antibody is produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, and the small molecule components are produced by chemical synthesis. POLIVY (polatuzumab vedotin-piiq) for injection is supplied as a sterile, white to grayish-white, preservative-free, lyophilized powder, which has a cake-like appearance, for intravenous infusion after reconstitution and dilution. Each single-dose 30 mg POLIVY vial delivers 30 mg of polatuzumab vedotin-piiq, polysorbate-20 (1.8 mg), sodium hydroxide (0.82 mg), succinic acid (1.77 mg), and sucrose (62 mg). After reconstitution with 1.8 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, the final concentration is 20 mg/mL with a pH of approximately 5.3. Each single-dose 140 mg POLIVY vial delivers 140 mg of polatuzumab vedotin-piiq, polysorbate-20 (8.4 mg), sodium hydroxide (3.80 mg), succinic acid (8.27 mg), and sucrose (288 mg). After reconstitution with 7.2 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, the final concentration is 20 mg/mL with a pH of approximately 5.3. The POLIVY vial stoppers are not made with natural rubber latex. Chemical Structure\"]",

Mosunetuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Polatuzumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, called polatuzumab, linked to a drug called vedotin. Polatuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, and delivers vedotin to kill them. Chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. CAR T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor. Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. Giving mosunetuzumab and/or polatuzumab vedotin after chemotherapy and CAR T-cell therapy may be more effective at controlling or shrinking the cancer than not giving them.",

The antibody in T-DM1 targets a marker on breast cancer cells called HER2, which allows the drug to go directly to the cancer cells. The use of T-DM1 in this study is considered standard treatment for the type of cancer in this study. Participants in this study have already been treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in the past, and their cancer has gotten worse in spite of those treatments. BYL719 is an oral drug (taken by mouth) that the researchers think may help T-DM1 to work better.",

Approximately 30% of patients with breast cancer have HER2 positive breast cancer. Before HER2 targeted therapies (i.e. treatments that directly block the receptor HER2) were developed, patients with HER2 positive breast cancer had a very aggressive form of disease. With the use of trastuzumab, an anticancer drug that directly targets the receptor HER2, and more recently, pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine, patients are able to live longer and have better control of their cancer.\n\nUnfortunately the use of HER2 targeted therapies can increase the risk of heart problems and for this reason these treatments were only studied and approved for patients with normal heart function.\n\nIn this study we plan to give HER2 targeted therapies to patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function along with concomitant evaluation by a heart doctor (called cardiologist) and appropriate medications to strengthen the heart. We will do frequent monitoring of the heart function with a test called echocardiogram that will give us a detailed \"picture\" of the heart. We will also draw blood along with routine blood tests to try to understand why some patients develop heart problems and others do not. The study will take a maximum of 12 months and patients will be monitored for 6 additional months.\n\nWe hypothesize that it is safe to administer HER2 targeted therapies to patients with breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function, i.e. LVEF between 40 and 50%, while on appropriate heart medications.",

People can take part in this study if their tumours show HER2 aberrations and previous treatment was not successful. The purpose of this study is to find a suitable dose of zongertinib that people with different types of HER2+ cancer that has spread can tolerate best when taken together with trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) or with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). Another purpose is to check whether zongertinib in combination with T-DXd or with T-DM1 can make tumours shrink. Zongertinib inhibits HER2. HER2 causes cancer cells to grow.\n\nThe study is split into treatment cycles. All study participants are treated with zongertinib in combination with T-DXd or with T-DM1. This study has 2 parts. In Part 1, participants receive increasing doses of zongertinib. In Part 2, participants are put into different groups by chance. Each group receives a different dose of zongertinib. Every participant has an equal chance of being in each group.\n\nDuring the study, the participants visit the study site regularly. In this study, researchers want to find the highest dose of zongertinib that participants can tolerate when taken together with T-DXd or with T-DM1. To find this out, researchers look at certain severe health problems that a number of participants have. The doctors regularly check the size of the tumour with imaging methods (CT/MRI) during the study. The doctors also regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects.",

T-DM1 is a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called DM1. Trastuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors, and delivers DM1 to kill them. Tucatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving T-DM1 and tucatinib may work better in preventing breast cancer from relapsing in patients with HER2 positive breast cancer compared to T-DM1 alone.",

The primary endpoint is anti-tumor activity or stable disease documented after 16 weeks of experimental drug treatment. The drugs used in the trial have been approved by EMA/FDA for the treatment of certain cancers. Choice of drug is based on whether the patient's cancer cells contain precisely the DNA change (i) targeted by the EMA/FDA-approved drug or (ii) related to sensitivity to the EMA/FDA-approved drug. The trial drug is thus not approved by the EMA/FDA or in Denmark for the treatment of the patient's cancer - it is so-called \"off-label use\". The secondary purposes are:\n\n* To detect side effects in patients treated with commercially available targeted cancer drugs.\n* Performing biomarker analyzes, including (but not limited to) whole-genome analysis (WGS) on a fresh tumor tissue sample (biopsy) at baseline and progression.\n* To investigate mechanisms of resistance using recurrent / serial fresh tumor biopsies for WGS and so-called liquid biopsies, which are blood samples in which the cancer cell DNA is analyzed.\n\nThe secondary endpoints include response duration, progression-free survival, and overall survival.",

ARX788 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that is given by infusion (diluted and injected slowly into veins). Antibodies are proteins which are naturally produced by the body's immune system to help fight infections. ARX788 consists of antibodies that have been attached to a toxin that has the potential to kill cancer cells. ARX788 sticks to a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), which is found on some breast cancer cells. Giving ARX788 may be safe and effective in treating patients with HER2-low locally advanced unresectable metastatic breast cancer.",

          "Brief Summary": "This phase II trial evaluates whether loncastuximab tesirine and rituximab followed by dose-adjusted doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone works to treat patients with high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Loncastuximab tesirine is a monoclonal antibody called loncastuximab, linked to a drug called tesirine. It is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as CD19 receptors, and delivers tesirine to kill them. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs such as doxorubicin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair and may kill cancer cells. Prednisone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It is used to reduce inflammation and lower the body's immune response to help lessen the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. Giving loncastuximab tesirine and rituximab in combination with dose-adjusted doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone may be more effective at treating high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients than standard treatments.",

Inotuzumab attaches to CD22 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers ozogamicin to kill them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving inotuzumab ozogamicin in combination with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells than with chemotherapy alone in treating patients with recurrent or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",

          "Brief Summary": "The purpose of this study is to test whether BV-AVD is an effective treatment in people with early stage, bulky Hodgkin lymphoma that was recently diagnosed and who have not yet received any treatments for their disease.\n\nBV is a type of drug called an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). ADCs are a substance made up of a monoclonal antibody chemically linked to a drug. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to fight infections and other possible harms to the body. The monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain types of cells, including cancer cells. The linked drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells. Researchers think BV may be an effective treatment for this type of cancer because the drug targets cells that have CD30, which play a role in cancer cell growth. By destroying these cells, BV may help slow or stop the growth of the cancer. AVD (doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) is a treatment regimen that works by stopping the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. The researchers think that BV in combination with AVD may work better than AVD alone to slow or stop the growth of the cancer.",

          "Brief Summary": "HER2 positive breast cancer cells have more HER2 receptor (a protein on the surface of cells) than normal breast cells. Approximately 30% of patients with breast cancer have HER2 positive breast cancer. Before HER2 targeted therapies (i.e. treatments that directly block the receptor HER2) were developed, patients with HER2 positive breast cancer had a very aggressive form of disease. With the use of trastuzumab, an anticancer drug that directly targets the receptor HER2, and more recently, pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine, patients are able to live longer and have better control of their cancer.\n\nUnfortunately the use of HER2 targeted therapies can increase the risk of heart problems and for this reason these treatments were only studied and approved for patients with normal heart function.\n\nIn this study we plan to give HER2 targeted therapies to patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function along with concomitant evaluation by a heart doctor (called cardiologist) and appropriate medications to strengthen the heart. We will do frequent monitoring of the heart function with a test called echocardiogram that will give us a detailed \"picture\" of the heart. We will also draw blood along with routine blood tests to try to understand why some patients develop heart problems and others do not. The study will take a maximum of 12 months and patients will be monitored for 6 additional months.\n\nWe hypothesize that it is safe to administer HER2 targeted therapies to patients with breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function, i.e. LVEF between 40 and 50%, while on appropriate heart medications.",

Taselisib is an investigational drug which works by blocking a protein called PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) that helps cancer cells grow. This drug has been used in laboratory experiments and information from these studies suggests that this drug may help to prevent or slow the growth of cancer cells. The main purpose of this study is to find the appropriate dose of Taselisib to be used with other drugs in further clinical studies. This is an open-label, 3+3 dose-escalation phase Ib study to identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose(s) (MTD) and to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Taselisib.

SSTR2 is over expressed on the cell surface of solid tumors including Neuroendocrine Tumors (NETs), Small Cell Lung Cancers (SCLC) and metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer. There remains an unmet medical need in these patient populations. In non-clinical experiments, PEN-221 binds with high affinity and selectivity to SSTR2. On binding, PEN-221 triggers SSTR2 internalization resulting in the accumulation of the DM1 payload in tumor cells followed by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. PEN-221 achieves complete and durable regressions in multiple SSTR2 xenograft mouse models.",

          "Study Status": "RECRUITING",
          "Brief Summary": "This phase II trial evaluates whether loncastuximab tesirine and rituximab followed by dose-adjusted doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone works to treat patients with high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Loncastuximab tesirine is a monoclonal antibody called loncastuximab, linked to a drug called tesirine. It is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as CD19 receptors, and delivers tesirine to kill them. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs such as doxorubicin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair and may kill cancer cells. Prednisone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It is used to reduce inflammation and lower the body's immune response to help lessen the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. Giving loncastuximab tesirine and rituximab in combination with dose-adjusted doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone may be more effective at treating high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients than standard treatments.",

          "Study Status": "RECRUITING",
          "Brief Summary": "This phase II trial studies how well the combination of avelumab with liposomal doxorubicin with or without binimetinib, or the combination of avelumab with sacituzumab govitecan works in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer that is stage IV or is not able to be removed by surgery (unresectable) and has come back (recurrent). Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors like avelumab require activation of the patient's immune system.\n\nThis trial includes a two week induction or lead-in of medications that can stimulate the immune system. It is our hope that this induction will improve the response to immunotherapy with avelumab. One treatment, sacituzumab Govitecan, is a monoclonal antibody called sacituzumab linked to a chemotherapy drug called SN-38. Sacituzumab govitecan is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of tumor cells, known as Tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (TROP2) receptors, and delivers SN-38 to kill them. Another treatment, liposomal doxorubicin, is a form of the anticancer drug doxorubicin that is contained in very tiny, fat-like particles. It may have fewer side effects and work better than doxorubicin, and may enhance factors associated with immune response. The third medication is called binimetinib, which may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth, and may help activate the immune system. It is not yet known whether giving avelumab in combination with liposomal doxorubicin with or without binimetinib, or the combination of avelumab with sacituzumab govitecan will work better in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer.",

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, prednisone, doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, and dacarbazine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. Giving brentuximab vedotin with combination chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells and reduce the need for radiation therapy.",

A Dose Expansion phase is planned for Regimen A and Regimen D and will open pending Sponsor decision; participants enrolled in the Dose Expansion phase will receive study treatment at the MTD or RP2D determined during Dose Escalation. For Regimen A, participants in the Dose Expansion phase may be enrolled according to prior exposure to bevacizumab into 3 Dose Expansion Cohorts as follows: 1) Dose Expansion Cohort 1: bevacizumab na\u00efve; 2) Dose Expansion Cohort 2: bevacizumab pretreated; and 3) Dose Expansion Cohort 3: one to three prior treatments, one of which could have been bevacizumab. A triplet Regimen (Regimen E: mirvetuximab soravtansine + bevacizumab + carboplatin) will be opened to evaluate the safety and tolerability and to assess any early signs of activity in participants dosed with the combination regimen. All mirvetuximab soravtansine doses were calculated according to adjusted ideal body weight.",

The first cycle of pembrolizumab will be administered in combination with brentuximab vedotin (BV) (\"lead-in treatment\").\n\nFollowing lead-in treatment, all participants will undergo interim PET/CT (iPET) as well as fitness testing to help inform participant level of fitness for subsequent lymphoma-directed therapies.\n\nParticipants deemed \"non-fit\" by this assessment will continue 3 additional 6 week cycles of concurrent pembrolizumab and BV (\"induction therapy\", each cycle is 42 days), then continue single-agent pembrolizumab to complete up to 4 additional cycles (i.e., 8 total) of therapy (\"consolidation and maintenance therapy\", Non-Fit cohort). Two additional BV doses will be given as consolidation, at days 1 and 22 of pembrolizumab cycle 5.\n\nThose deemed \"fit\" after lead-in therapy (Fit cohort) will continue pembrolizumab and switch from BV to concurrently-administered combination chemotherapy using doxorubicin (A), vinblastine (V), and dacarbazine (D) for a total of 4 planned AVD cycles (3, 6-week pembrolizumab cycles, \"induction therapy\"). Chemotherapy drugs will be given at standard doses as in ABVD (no bleomycin will be given in this study) on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle (C1AVD), and pembrolizumab dosing will remain every 42 days. Following end-induction PET/CT, pembrolizumab will continue every 42 days for up to 4 cycles in the consolidation/maintenance phase. Two additional BV doses will be given as consolidation, at days 1 and 22 of pembrolizumab cycle 5.",

Inotuzumab ozogamicin is a monoclonal antibody, called inotuzumab, linked to a toxic agent called ozogamicin. Inotuzumab attaches to CD22 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers ozogamicin to kill them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving inotuzumab ozogamicin in combination with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells than with chemotherapy alone in treating patients with recurrent or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",

          "Brief Summary": "The purpose of this study is to test whether BV-AVD is an effective treatment in people with early stage, bulky Hodgkin lymphoma that was recently diagnosed and who have not yet received any treatments for their disease.\n\nBV is a type of drug called an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). ADCs are a substance made up of a monoclonal antibody chemically linked to a drug. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to fight infections and other possible harms to the body. The monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain types of cells, including cancer cells. The linked drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells. Researchers think BV may be an effective treatment for this type of cancer because the drug targets cells that have CD30, which play a role in cancer cell growth. By destroying these cells, BV may help slow or stop the growth of the cancer. AVD (doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) is a treatment regimen that works by stopping the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. The researchers think that BV in combination with AVD may work better than AVD alone to slow or stop the growth of the cancer.",

Following administration of praluzatamab ravtansine and migration to the tumor microenvironment (TME), the cleavable masking peptide, which prevent anti-CD166 antibody binding to the CD166 expressed on both normal cells and tumor cells, is proteolytically cleaved by tumor-associated proteases that are specifically present in the TME. This enables the anti-CD166 antibody moiety of CX-2009 to selectively bind to, be internalized by, and deliver DM4 into CD166-expressing tumor cells. Following internalization, DM4 is released, binds to tubulin and disrupts microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics, resulting in inhibition of cell division and cell growth of CD166-expressing tumor cells. The masking peptide prevents binding of the anti-CD166 antibody to CD166 in normal tissues, thereby minimizing toxicities.",

The drug is the active ingredient in irinotecan which is a common chemotherapy drug used for colorectal cancer. Antibodies are proteins normally made by the immune system. They bind to substances that don't belong in the body to prevent harm to the body. The antibody in this study was designed to bind to a marker located on colorectal cancer tumors. The antibody was originally made from mouse proteins, but was changed in the laboratory to be more like human antibodies. This study will investigate how IMMU-130 acts for the treatment of colorectal cancer. The study is mainly being done to see if IMMU-130 is safe.",

Upon intravenous administration of TAK-164, the antibody moiety selectively binds to GCC-expressing cells. Upon antibody/antigen binding and internalization, the cytotoxic DGN549 payload is released and binds to guanine residues on opposing strands of DNA. This induces DNA strand breaks, inhibits DNA replication, leads to G2/M cell cycle arrest, induces cell death, and inhibits the proliferation of GCC-expressing cells.",

          "Brief Summary": "HER2 positive breast cancer cells have more HER2 receptor (a protein on the surface of cells) than normal breast cells. Approximately 30% of patients with breast cancer have HER2 positive breast cancer. Before HER2 targeted therapies (i.e. treatments that directly block the receptor HER2) were developed, patients with HER2 positive breast cancer had a very aggressive form of disease. With the use of trastuzumab, an anticancer drug that directly targets the receptor HER2, and more recently, pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine, patients are able to live longer and have better control of their cancer.\n\nUnfortunately the use of HER2 targeted therapies can increase the risk of heart problems and for this reason these treatments were only studied and approved for patients with normal heart function.\n\nIn this study we plan to give HER2 targeted therapies to patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function along with concomitant evaluation by a heart doctor (called cardiologist) and appropriate medications to strengthen the heart. We will do frequent monitoring of the heart function with a test called echocardiogram that will give us a detailed \"picture\" of the heart. We will also draw blood along with routine blood tests to try to understand why some patients develop heart problems and others do not. The study will take a maximum of 12 months and patients will be monitored for 6 additional months.\n\nWe hypothesize that it is safe to administer HER2 targeted therapies to patients with breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function, i.e. LVEF between 40 and 50%, while on appropriate heart medications.",

The dose escalation part (Part A) of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of CC-99712, administered intravenously (IV) in monotherapy (Arm 1) or combination with BMS-986405 (Arm 2), to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CC-99712 guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM). A modified accelerated titration design will also be used for Arm 1 and Arm 2. The MTD may be established separately for CC-99712 administered at Q3W and/ or Q4W schedules. The expansion part (Part B) will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CC-99712 in monotherapy (Arm 1) or combination (Arm 2) administered at or below the MTD in selected expansion cohorts in order to determine the RP2D. One or more doses or dosing regimens may be selected for cohort expansion. All participants will be treated until confirmed disease progression per IMWG criteria, unacceptable toxicity, or participants//Investigator decision to withdraw.",

Patient medical records, routine safety lab tests and other necessary medical monitoring will be conducted by the investigators and site medical staff during the study.  Eligible patients will be enrolled into one specific dose cohort following the study progress. Intra-patient dose escalation will not be allowed. Dose cohorts planned for the dose escalation are 1.2 mg/kg, 2.4 mg/kg, 3.6 mg/kg, 4.8 mg/kg, and 6.0 mg/kg. Eight cycles treatment was planned for each enrolled patient. The safety review by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) will occur on a continual basis through the duration of the study. The SCR will monitor the safety and provide decisions as to dose escalations and exploring intermediate or higher doses. Patients may stay on the study treatment longer, until disease progression occurs, unacceptable toxicity occurs, or voluntarily withdraw the consent.",

Once a solid tumor has grown very large in one spot or has spread to other places in the body, it is called advanced or metastatic cancer. Participants in this study must have head and neck squamous cell cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, endometrial cancer, or ovarian cancer. Participants must have tumors that have a marker called HER2.\n\nThis clinical trial uses an experimental drug called disitamab vedotin (DV). DV is a type of antibody-drug conjugate or ADC. ADCs are designed to stick to cancer cells and kill them. In this study, all participants will get DV once every 2 weeks.\n\nThis study is being done to see if DV works to treat different types of solid tumors that express HER2. It will also test how safe the drug is for participants. This trial will also study what side effects happen when participants get the drug. A side effect is anything a drug does to your body besides treating the disease.",

Once they've grown bigger in one spot or spread to other parts of the body, they're harder to treat. This is called advanced or metastatic cancer.\n\nParticipants in this study must have breast cancer or gastric cancer. Participants must have tumors that have HER2 on them. This allows the cancer to grow more quickly or spread faster. There are few treatment options for patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that express HER2.\n\nThis clinical trial uses an experimental drug called disitamab vedotin (DV). Disitamab vedotin is a type of antibody drug conjugate or ADC. ADCs are designed to stick to cancer cells and kill them.\n\nThis clinical trial uses a drug called tucatinib, which has been approved to treat cancer in the United States and some other countries. This drug is sold under the brand name TUKYSA\u00ae.\n\nThis study will test how safe and how well DV, with or without tucatinib, is for participants with solid tumors. This study will also test what side effects happen when participants take these drugs. A side effect is anything a drug does to the body besides treating the disease.",

This study will try to find out if the drugs disitamab vedotin with pembrolizumab works better than platinum-containing chemotherapy to treat patients with UC. This study will also test what side effects happen when participants take these drugs together. A side effect is anything a drug does to the body besides treating the disease.\n\nParticipants in this study will have cancer that has spread through the body (metastatic) or spread near where it started (locally advanced).\n\nIn this study, there are 2 different groups. Participants will be assigned to a group randomly. Participants in the disitamab vedotin arm will get the study drug disitamab vedotin once every two weeks and pembrolizumab once every 6 weeks. Participants in the standard of care arm will get gemcitabine once a week for 2 weeks with either cisplatin or carboplatin once every 3 weeks.",

SG3199 attached to the linker is designated as SG3249, also known as tesirine. Loncastuximab tesirine-lpyl has an approximate molecular weight of 151 kDa. An average of 2.3 molecules of SG3249 are attached to each antibody molecule. Loncastuximab tesirine-lpyl is produced by chemical conjugation of the antibody and small molecule components. The antibody is produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, and the small molecule components are produced by chemical synthesis. ZYNLONTA (loncastuximab tesirine-lpyl) for injection is supplied as a sterile, white to off-white, preservative-free, lyophilized powder, which has a cake-like appearance, for intravenous infusion after reconstitution and dilution. Each single-dose vial delivers 10 mg of loncastuximab tesirine-lpyl, L-histidine (2.8 mg), L-histidine monohydrochloride (4.6 mg), polysorbate 20 (0.4 mg), and sucrose (119.8 mg).

          "Brief Summary": "This phase II trial evaluates whether loncastuximab tesirine and rituximab followed by dose-adjusted doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone works to treat patients with high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Loncastuximab tesirine is a monoclonal antibody called loncastuximab, linked to a drug called tesirine. It is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as CD19 receptors, and delivers tesirine to kill them. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs such as doxorubicin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair and may kill cancer cells. Prednisone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It is used to reduce inflammation and lower the body's immune response to help lessen the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. Giving loncastuximab tesirine and rituximab in combination with dose-adjusted doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone may be more effective at treating high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients than standard treatments.",

          "Brief Summary": "The Glo-BNHL trial is trying to find better medicines for children and young people with B-cell non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL) that does not go away (refractory B-NHL) or does but comes back again (relapsed B-NHL). B-NHL is a type of cancer that develops inside or outside of lymph nodes (glands) and organs such as the liver or spleen. Examples of B-NHL are Burkitt Lymphoma and Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma, which may be other names used to describe this type of cancer. It is very difficult to cure relapsed or refractory B-NHL. The medicines used now are very powerful with many side effects and only cure around 30 in every 100 children treated. It is very important that investigators quickly find better medicines for these children and young people.\n\nThe Glo-BNHL trial will include three groups of children and young people, each given a new medicine (either alone or with chemotherapy). The investigators are looking to make sure the new medicines are safe and that they work to treat the cancer. If the medicine in one group does not work for a child in the trial, then they may be able to join a different group to have another new medicine.\n\nExperts from around the world will carefully pick the medicines most likely to be helpful to be part of the trial. If one of the new medicines seems not to be working as well as hoped then the investigators will take it out of the trial as soon as possible. This will let other new medicines be added to the trial and tested. If a medicine does seem to be working well, then it will continue in the trial to make sure it really is the most useful medicine available.\n\nChildren from around the world will be invited to take part in the trial. The investigators will then check on them for at least two years after they finish the trial treatment to look for possible side effects of the new medicine.",

The monoclonal antibody is produced in a mammalian cell cline (Chinese hamster ovary). MMAE and the linker are produced by chemical synthesis. Each monoclonal antibody molecule carries an average of 4 MMAE molecules. Tisotumab vedotin-tftv has an approximate molecular weight of 153 kDa. The chemical structure is as follows: Figure 1. Structural Formula TIVDAK (tisotumab vedotin-tftv) for injection, is provided as a sterile, preservative-free, white to off-white lyophilized cake or powder in a single-dose vial for infusion after dilution. Following reconstitution with 4 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to brownish-yellow solution containing 10 mg/mL tisotumab vedotin-tftv is produced [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Each mL of reconstituted solution contains 10 mg of tisotumab vedotin-tftv, d-mannitol (30 mg), l-histidine (2.11 mg), l-histidine monohydrochloride (3.44 mg), and sucrose (30 mg), at pH 6.0.\"]",

          "Brief Summary": "This trial will study tisotumab vedotin to find out what its side effects are and to see if it works for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC). It will test different doses of tisotumab vedotin that are given at different times. It will also compare the side effects and ability to treat tumors of these different doses and schedules. In this study, there will be a safety run-in group of approximately 12 patients that will look at a dose-dense treatment schedule. In a dose-dense schedule, smaller doses are given more frequently. In addition to the safety run-in patients, there will be three groups in the study. One group will get tisotumab vedotin once every 3 weeks (21-day cycles). The two other groups will get tisotumab vedotin once a week for 3 weeks followed by 1 week off (28-day cycles).",

The investigational drug activates myeloid cells in settings of moderate or high HER2 expression leading to induction of multiple anti-tumor immune mechanisms including proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production, inflammasome activation, direct activation of dendritic cells (DCs), and indirect T and natural killer (NK) cell cytolytic activity.  The drug can induce both macrophage killing of tumor cells and dendritic cells to promote tumor-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses.",

          "Brief Summary": "HER2 positive breast cancer cells have more HER2 receptor (a protein on the surface of cells) than normal breast cells. Approximately 30% of patients with breast cancer have HER2 positive breast cancer. Before HER2 targeted therapies (i.e. treatments that directly block the receptor HER2) were developed, patients with HER2 positive breast cancer had a very aggressive form of disease. With the use of trastuzumab, an anticancer drug that directly targets the receptor HER2, and more recently, pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine, patients are able to live longer and have better control of their cancer.\n\nUnfortunately the use of HER2 targeted therapies can increase the risk of heart problems and for this reason these treatments were only studied and approved for patients with normal heart function.\n\nIn this study we plan to give HER2 targeted therapies to patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function along with concomitant evaluation by a heart doctor (called cardiologist) and appropriate medications to strengthen the heart. We will do frequent monitoring of the heart function with a test called echocardiogram that will give us a detailed \"picture\" of the heart. We will also draw blood along with routine blood tests to try to understand why some patients develop heart problems and others do not. The study will take a maximum of 12 months and patients will be monitored for 6 additional months.\n\nWe hypothesize that it is safe to administer HER2 targeted therapies to patients with breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function, i.e. LVEF between 40 and 50%, while on appropriate heart medications.",

          "Brief Summary": "HER2 positive breast cancer cells have more HER2 receptor (a protein on the surface of cells) than normal breast cells. Approximately 30% of patients with breast cancer have HER2 positive breast cancer. Before HER2 targeted therapies (i.e. treatments that directly block the receptor HER2) were developed, patients with HER2 positive breast cancer had a very aggressive form of disease. With the use of trastuzumab, an anticancer drug that directly targets the receptor HER2, and more recently, pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine, patients are able to live longer and have better control of their cancer.\n\nUnfortunately the use of HER2 targeted therapies can increase the risk of heart problems and for this reason these treatments were only studied and approved for patients with normal heart function.\n\nIn this study we plan to give HER2 targeted therapies to patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function along with concomitant evaluation by a heart doctor (called cardiologist) and appropriate medications to strengthen the heart. We will do frequent monitoring of the heart function with a test called echocardiogram that will give us a detailed \"picture\" of the heart. We will also draw blood along with routine blood tests to try to understand why some patients develop heart problems and others do not. The study will take a maximum of 12 months and patients will be monitored for 6 additional months.\n\nWe hypothesize that it is safe to administer HER2 targeted therapies to patients with breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function, i.e. LVEF between 40 and 50%, while on appropriate heart medications.",

Taselisib is an investigational drug which works by blocking a protein called PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) that helps cancer cells grow. This drug has been used in laboratory experiments and information from these studies suggests that this drug may help to prevent or slow the growth of cancer cells. The main purpose of this study is to find the appropriate dose of Taselisib to be used with other drugs in further clinical studies. This is an open-label, 3+3 dose-escalation phase Ib study to identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose(s) (MTD) and to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Taselisib. This study will be conducted in 4 separate arms. (A-D).",

The study is designed to characterize safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity. Participants with relapsed or refractory, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors including, but not limited to, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), melanoma, pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ovarian cancer, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) will be enrolled.\n\nVobramitamab duocarmazine and lorigerlimab are administered separately on Day 1 of every 4-week (28-day) cycle at the assigned dose for each cohort. Participants who do not meet criteria for study drug discontinuation may receive study drugs for up to 2 years.\n\nTumor assessments are performed every 8 weeks (\u00b1 7 days) for the initial 6 months on study drugs, then every 12 weeks (\u00b1 21 days) until progressive disease (PD).\n\nParticipants will be followed for safety throughout the study. .",

          "Brief Summary": "This phase I trial finds the best dose of PVEK when given together with fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and idarubicin, (FLAG-Ida) regimen and studies the effectiveness of this combination therapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed adverse risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other high-grade myeloid neoplasms. PVEK is a monoclonal antibody linked to a chemotherapy drug. PVEK is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as CD123 receptors, and delivers the chemotherapy drug to kill them. Chemotherapy drugs, such as idarubicin, fludarabine, high-dose cytarabine work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. G-CSF helps the bone marrow make more white blood cells in patients with low white blood cell count due to cancer treatment. Giving PVEK with the FLAG-Ida regimen may be a safe and effective treatment for patients with acute myeloid leukemia and other high-grade myeloid neoplasms.",

          "Brief Summary": "HER2 positive breast cancer cells have more HER2 receptor (a protein on the surface of cells) than normal breast cells. Approximately 30% of patients with breast cancer have HER2 positive breast cancer. Before HER2 targeted therapies (i.e. treatments that directly block the receptor HER2) were developed, patients with HER2 positive breast cancer had a very aggressive form of disease. With the use of trastuzumab, an anticancer drug that directly targets the receptor HER2, and more recently, pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine, patients are able to live longer and have better control of their cancer.\n\nUnfortunately the use of HER2 targeted therapies can increase the risk of heart problems and for this reason these treatments were only studied and approved for patients with normal heart function.\n\nIn this study we plan to give HER2 targeted therapies to patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function along with concomitant evaluation by a heart doctor (called cardiologist) and appropriate medications to strengthen the heart. We will do frequent monitoring of the heart function with a test called echocardiogram that will give us a detailed \"picture\" of the heart. We will also draw blood along with routine blood tests to try to understand why some patients develop heart problems and others do not. The study will take a maximum of 12 months and patients will be monitored for 6 additional months.\n\nWe hypothesize that it is safe to administer HER2 targeted therapies to patients with breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function, i.e. LVEF between 40 and 50%, while on appropriate heart medications.",

This drug has been used in laboratory experiments and information from these studies suggests that this drug may help to prevent or slow the growth of cancer cells. The main purpose of this study is to find the appropriate dose of Taselisib to be used with other drugs in further clinical studies. This is an open-label, 3+3 dose-escalation phase Ib study to identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose(s) (MTD) and to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Taselisib.

Mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx has an approximate molecular weight of 150 kDa. An average of 3.4 molecules of DM4 are attached to each antibody molecule. Mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx is produced by chemical conjugation of the antibody and small molecule components. The antibody is produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, and the small molecule components are produced by chemical synthesis. Mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx has the following structure: ELAHERE (mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx) injection is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free, clear to slightly opalescent, colorless solution containing 100 mg/20 mL of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx in single-dose vials.

          "Brief Summary": "HER2 positive breast cancer cells have more HER2 receptor (a protein on the surface of cells) than normal breast cells. Approximately 30% of patients with breast cancer have HER2 positive breast cancer. Before HER2 targeted therapies (i.e. treatments that directly block the receptor HER2) were developed, patients with HER2 positive breast cancer had a very aggressive form of disease. With the use of trastuzumab, an anticancer drug that directly targets the receptor HER2, and more recently, pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine, patients are able to live longer and have better control of their cancer.\n\nUnfortunately the use of HER2 targeted therapies can increase the risk of heart problems and for this reason these treatments were only studied and approved for patients with normal heart function.\n\nIn this study we plan to give HER2 targeted therapies to patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function along with concomitant evaluation by a heart doctor (called cardiologist) and appropriate medications to strengthen the heart. We will do frequent monitoring of the heart function with a test called echocardiogram that will give us a detailed \"picture\" of the heart. We will also draw blood along with routine blood tests to try to understand why some patients develop heart problems and others do not. The study will take a maximum of 12 months and patients will be monitored for 6 additional months.\n\nWe hypothesize that it is safe to administer HER2 targeted therapies to patients with breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function, i.e. LVEF between 40 and 50%, while on appropriate heart medications.",

The aim of the study is to see how safe, tolerable, and effective the study drug is. This study will include 3 study groups, or cohorts, and each group is split into 2 parts:\n\nPart 1: The main purpose of part 1 is to determine a safe dose of REGN5093-M114 (Cohorts A and B), and in combination with cemiplimab (Cohort C).\n\nPart 2: The main purpose of part 2 is to use the REGN5093-M114 dose found for each cohort in part 1 to see how well the study drug works to shrink tumors.\n\nThe study is looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* What side effects may happen from receiving the study drug\n* Does the study drug work to reduce or delay the progression of your cancer\n* How much study drug is in the blood at different times\n* Does the body make antibodies against the study drug (which could make the drug less effective or could lead to side effects)",

Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of three components: 1) a humanized anti-HER2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), covalently linked to 2) a topoisomerase inhibitor, via 3) a tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker. Deruxtecan is composed of a protease-cleavable maleimide tetrapeptide linker and the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd, which is an exatecan derivative. The antibody is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells by recombinant DNA technology, and the topoisomerase inhibitor and linker are produced by chemical synthesis. Approximately 8 molecules of deruxtecan are attached to each antibody molecule. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki has the following structure: ENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) is a sterile, white to yellowish white, preservative-free lyophilized powder in single-dose vials. Each vial delivers 100 mg of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, L-histidine (4.45 mg), L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate (20.2 mg), polysorbate 80 (1.5 mg), and sucrose (450 mg). Following reconstitution with 5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, the resulting concentration of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is 20 mg/mL with a pH of 5.5.

Trastuzumab deruxtecan is a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug called deruxtecan. Trastuzumab attaches to HER2 expressed at low levels on cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers deruxtecan to kill them. Anastrozole works by decreasing estrogen production and suppressing the growth of tumors that need estrogen to grow. This study is evaluating how effective trastuzumab deruxtecan is at treating hormone receptor positive cancer cells that have low levels of HER2 expressed on them when given alone or in combination with anastrozole.",

          "Brief Summary": "HER2 positive breast cancer cells have more HER2 receptor (a protein on the surface of cells) than normal breast cells. Approximately 30% of patients with breast cancer have HER2 positive breast cancer. Before HER2 targeted therapies (i.e. treatments that directly block the receptor HER2) were developed, patients with HER2 positive breast cancer had a very aggressive form of disease. With the use of trastuzumab, an anticancer drug that directly targets the receptor HER2, and more recently, pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine, patients are able to live longer and have better control of their cancer.\n\nUnfortunately the use of HER2 targeted therapies can increase the risk of heart problems and for this reason these treatments were only studied and approved for patients with normal heart function.\n\nIn this study we plan to give HER2 targeted therapies to patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function along with concomitant evaluation by a heart doctor (called cardiologist) and appropriate medications to strengthen the heart. We will do frequent monitoring of the heart function with a test called echocardiogram that will give us a detailed \"picture\" of the heart. We will also draw blood along with routine blood tests to try to understand why some patients develop heart problems and others do not. The study will take a maximum of 12 months and patients will be monitored for 6 additional months.\n\nWe hypothesize that it is safe to administer HER2 targeted therapies to patients with breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function, i.e. LVEF between 40 and 50%, while on appropriate heart medications.",

The first 8 cycles of T-DXd are administered neo-adjuvant, and 8 cycles adjuvant, after completion of local treatment.\n\nThe proposed M22BOL trial is based on an important knowledge gap for regarding breast cancer patients with 'oligo-metastatic' disease who are usually not included in clinical trials for patients with metastatic disease since loco-regional treatments (radiation, surgery) with curative intent is not allowed in clinical trials for metastatic breast cancer. Moreover, neo-adjuvant trial protocols for early breast cancer exclude patients with distant metastases that can be treated with curative intent. This basket trial evaluates T-DXd for oligo-metastatic breast cancer with the goal to induce deep responses and subsequently long-lasting disease remissions and potentially cure.",

This drug has been used in laboratory experiments and information from these studies suggests that this drug may help to prevent or slow the growth of cancer cells. The main purpose of this study is to find the appropriate dose of Taselisib to be used with other drugs in further clinical studies. This is an open-label, 3+3 dose-escalation phase Ib study to identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose(s) (MTD) and to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Taselisib. This study will be conducted in 4 separate arms. (A-D).",

          "Brief Summary": "This study is open to adults aged 18 years and older with different types of HER2+ cancer that has spread and cannot be removed by surgery. People can take part in this study if their tumours show HER2 aberrations and previous treatment was not successful. The purpose of this study is to find a suitable dose of zongertinib that people with different types of HER2+ cancer that has spread can tolerate best when taken together with trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) or with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). Another purpose is to check whether zongertinib in combination with T-DXd or with T-DM1 can make tumours shrink. Zongertinib inhibits HER2. HER2 causes cancer cells to grow.\n\nThe study is split into treatment cycles. All study participants are treated with zongertinib in combination with T-DXd or with T-DM1. This study has 2 parts. In Part 1, participants receive increasing doses of zongertinib. In Part 2, participants are put into different groups by chance. Each group receives a different dose of zongertinib. Every participant has an equal chance of being in each group.\n\nDuring the study, the participants visit the study site regularly. In this study, researchers want to find the highest dose of zongertinib that participants can tolerate when taken together with T-DXd or with T-DM1. To find this out, researchers look at certain severe health problems that a number of participants have. The doctors regularly check the size of the tumour with imaging methods (CT/MRI) during the study. The doctors also regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects.",

BL-B01D1 blocks EGFR and HER3 signals to cancer cells, reducing proliferation and survival signals.

The recombinant monoclonal antibody is produced by mammalian (murine myeloma) cells, while the small molecule components SN-38 and CL2A are produced by chemical synthesis. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy contains on average 7 to 8 molecules of SN-38 per antibody molecule. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy has a molecular weight of approximately 160 kilodaltons. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy has the following chemical structure. TRODELVY (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy) for injection is a sterile, preservative-free, off-white to yellowish lyophilized powder for intravenous use in a 50 mL clear glass single-dose vial, with a rubber stopper and crimp-sealed with an aluminum flip-off cap. Each single-dose vial of TRODELVY delivers 180 mg sacituzumab govitecan-hziy, 77.3 mg 2-(N-morpholino) ethane sulfonic acid (MES), 1.8 mg polysorbate 80 and 154 mg trehalose dihydrate.

          "Brief Summary": "This phase II trial studies how well the combination of avelumab with liposomal doxorubicin with or without binimetinib, or the combination of avelumab with sacituzumab govitecan works in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer that is stage IV or is not able to be removed by surgery (unresectable) and has come back (recurrent). Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors like avelumab require activation of the patient's immune system.\n\nThis trial includes a two week induction or lead-in of medications that can stimulate the immune system. It is our hope that this induction will improve the response to immunotherapy with avelumab. One treatment, sacituzumab Govitecan, is a monoclonal antibody called sacituzumab linked to a chemotherapy drug called SN-38. Sacituzumab govitecan is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of tumor cells, known as Tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (TROP2) receptors, and delivers SN-38 to kill them. Another treatment, liposomal doxorubicin, is a form of the anticancer drug doxorubicin that is contained in very tiny, fat-like particles. It may have fewer side effects and work better than doxorubicin, and may enhance factors associated with immune response. The third medication is called binimetinib, which may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth, and may help activate the immune system. It is not yet known whether giving avelumab in combination with liposomal doxorubicin with or without binimetinib, or the combination of avelumab with sacituzumab govitecan will work better in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer.",

          "Brief Summary": "This phase II trial tests whether sacituzumab govitecan given before radical cystectomy works in treating patients with non-urothelial bladder cancer. Sacituzumab govitecan contains a monoclonal antibody, called sacituzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called govitecan. Sacituzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as TROP2 receptors, and delivers govitecan to kill them. Giving sacituzumab govitecan before radical cystectomy may make the surgery more effective in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer.",

Sacituzumab govitecan is a monoclonal antibody, called sacituzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called govitecan. Sacituzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules on the surface of cancer cells, known as Trop-2 receptors, and delivers govitecan to kill them. Giving sacituzumab govitecan may shrink the cancer in the brain and/or extend the time until the cancer gets worse.",

Following intravenous administration of XMT-2056, the anti-HER2 antibody moiety targets and binds to HER2 while the STING agonist targets and binds to STING on immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This allows for specific activation of the STING pathway in the TME. In turn, this leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interferons (IFNs), enhances the cross-presentation of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) by dendritic cells (DCs), and induces a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against cancer cells.  STING, a transmembrane protein that activates immune cells in the TME, plays a key role in the activation of the innate immune system. The conjugation of the anti-HER2 antibody to the STING agonist improves targeted delivery of the STING agonist and increases tumor exposure and enhances the STING-mediated anti-tumor immune responses while limiting systemic toxicity.",

Participants have to be hormone-receptor positive (HR+) and have to be resistant to endocrine therapy and cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors. Participants may have received multiple lines of endocrine therapy with or without targeted therapies and must have received only one line of chemotherapy for ABC.\n\nMoreover, the immune effects, the predictors of resistance and response to treatment, the effect of the chemotherapy on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication will be assessed and will help identify the subgroups that will mostly benefit from the treatment. The pharmacokinetics of the product and the anti-drug antibody (ADA) will be also evaluated.\n\nA total of 100 participants are planned to be treated in the study.

The investigational agent has showed good stability and improved safety profiles, presumably due to the proper steric hindrance which was purposely designed on the payload (SHR9265). Less than 2% of payload release was observed in human plasma after a 21-day incubation.",

          "Brief Summary": "HER2 positive breast cancer cells have more HER2 receptor (a protein on the surface of cells) than normal breast cells. Approximately 30% of patients with breast cancer have HER2 positive breast cancer. Before HER2 targeted therapies (i.e. treatments that directly block the receptor HER2) were developed, patients with HER2 positive breast cancer had a very aggressive form of disease. With the use of trastuzumab, an anticancer drug that directly targets the receptor HER2, and more recently, pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine, patients are able to live longer and have better control of their cancer.\n\nUnfortunately the use of HER2 targeted therapies can increase the risk of heart problems and for this reason these treatments were only studied and approved for patients with normal heart function.\n\nIn this study we plan to give HER2 targeted therapies to patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function along with concomitant evaluation by a heart doctor (called cardiologist) and appropriate medications to strengthen the heart. We will do frequent monitoring of the heart function with a test called echocardiogram that will give us a detailed \"picture\" of the heart. We will also draw blood along with routine blood tests to try to understand why some patients develop heart problems and others do not. The study will take a maximum of 12 months and patients will be monitored for 6 additional months.\n\nWe hypothesize that it is safe to administer HER2 targeted therapies to patients with breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function, i.e. LVEF between 40 and 50%, while on appropriate heart medications.",

DESCRIPTION Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of the CD33-directed monoclonal antibody (hP67.6; recombinant humanized immunoglobulin [Ig] G4, kappa antibody produced by mammalian cell culture in NS0 cells) that is covalently linked to the cytotoxic agent N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin consists of conjugated and unconjugated gemtuzumab. The conjugated molecules differ in the number of activated calicheamicin derivative moieties attached to gemtuzumab. The number of conjugated calicheamicin derivatives per gemtuzumab molecule ranges from predominantly zero to 6, with an average of 2 to 3 moles of calicheamicin derivative per mole of gemtuzumab. MYLOTARG (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) for injection is supplied as a sterile, white to off-white, preservative-free lyophilized cake or powder for intravenous administration. Each single-dose vial delivers 4.5 mg gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Inactive ingredients are dextran 40 (41.0 mg), sodium chloride (26.1 mg), sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous (2.7 mg), sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate (0.45 mg), and sucrose (69.8 mg).

          "Brief Summary": "This is a Phase Ib Study to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Venetoclax in combination with Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin(GO) in subjects with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Using a standard 3+3 design, subjects will receive once cycle of combination therapy. After one cycle of combination therapy, subjects showing response will continue on to one cycle of consolidation therapy with GO\\\\Veneoclax. Subjects who respond to combination therapy will continue on maintenance Venetoclax until progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nDose-limiting toxicity, defined as an adverse event related (possible, probably, or definite) to Venetoclax and/or Gemtuzumab fulfilling one of the following criteria:\n\ncriteria:\n\n* Hematologic toxicity: treatment-related grade 3 or worse neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow hypocellularity present at the end of cycle one (day 28) with an additional 28 days allowed for count recovery (i.e. present at day 56); specifically grade 3 or worse neutropenia or thrombocytopenia with the bone marrow documented to be free of leukemic infiltration. Note: patients who enter the study with grade 3 or worse cytopenias will not be evaluable for hematologic dose-limiting toxicities.\n* Non-hematologic toxicity: any grade 3 or worse treatment-related toxicity occurring within the first cycle (excluding grade 3-4 infections during cycle one).\n\nThe study will also evaluate the Overall Response Rate, Anti-leukemic activity, Relapse-free Survival (RFS), event-free survival (EFS) , and overall survival (OS). The study will evaluate quality of life using the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer 30 item questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30).",

It is infused, attaches to cells with a certain marker on the surface (the majority of which would be leukemia cells). The drug is then internalized and the chemotherapy drug becomes activated. Gemtuzumab is currently FDA approved for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.\n\nThe infusion of leukocytes to stimulate the immune system to fight your leukemia is investigational and has not been proven to cure cancer. This combination of Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin and donor leukocytes is not an FDA approved treatment and is investigational.\n\nInitially a total of 6 patients will be included in the study to assess the safety of the treatment.

Brentuximab vedotin has an approximate molecular weight of 153 kDa. Approximately 4 molecules of MMAE are attached to each antibody molecule. Brentuximab vedotin is produced by chemical conjugation of the antibody and small molecule components. The antibody is produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, and the small molecule components are produced by chemical synthesis. ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) for injection is supplied as a sterile, white to off-white, preservative-free lyophilized cake or powder in single-dose vials. Following reconstitution with 10.5 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP, a solution containing 5 mg/mL brentuximab vedotin is produced. The reconstituted product contains 70 mg/mL trehalose dihydrate, 5.6 mg/mL sodium citrate dihydrate, 0.21 mg/mL citric acid monohydrate, and 0.20 mg/mL polysorbate 80 and water for injection.

          "Study Status": "ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING",
          "Brief Summary": "Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a rare form of cancer found mostly among people from the Caribbean islands, Western Africa, Brazil, Iran, and Japan. Most cases of this disease in the United States occur along the East Coast due to emigration from the Caribbean islands. There is currently no standard treatment for ATLL. Research shows that patients who go into first time remission (respond completely or partially to treatment) and have a bone marrow transplant have the best outcomes. Traditional chemotherapy treatments have generally not worked well in patients with ATLL. Additionally, not all patients will be eligible for a bone marrow transplant.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to see how well individuals with ATLL respond to an investigational cancer treatment. This investigational treatment combines a drug called brentuximab vedotin with a standard chemotherapy treatment made up of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, and prednisone. This treatment is considered investigational because it is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of ATLL.\n\nBrentuximab vedotin, also known as Adcetris, is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of certain types of lymphomas, including peripheral T-cell lymphomas when combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone in patients whose cancer cells express a type of marker called CD30.\n\nBrentuximab vedotin is an antibody that also has a chemotherapy drug attached to it. Antibodies are proteins that are part of the immune system. They can stick to and attack specific targets on cancer cells. The antibody part of brentuximab vedotin sticks to a target called cluster of differentiation 30 (CD30) that is located on the outside of the cancer cells. Normal cells have little or no CD30 on their surface. ATLL cancer cells often have a larger amount of CD30 on their surface than normal cells. However, CD30 is found in different amounts on ATLL cancer cells. This study will also test the amount of CD30 found on each participant's cancer cells. Researchers will be looking to see if the response to the study treatment varies based on the amount of CD30 found on the outside participants' cancer cells.\n\nIn another study, brentuximab vedotin was combined in another study with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone. The study included patients with various types of T-cell lymphomas. Two of the patients enrolled in that study had ATLL. Both had a complete response (no evidence of disease). The researchers in this study (LCCC 1637) have added etoposide to the combination of brentuximab vedotin with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone. They predict that the addition of etoposide will improve patient outcomes. Research shows that etoposide helps improve outcomes in patients with certain types of T-cell lymphomas who undergo chemotherapy treatment. This investigational combination of brentuximab vedotin with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, and prednisone is called BV-CHEP.",

          "Brief Summary": "The purpose of this study is determine if 2 cycles of SGN-35 can be used instead of ICE prior to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) for relapsed and refractory HL. There are 2 steps to treating patients with relapsed or refractory HL. The first step is to shrink the lymphoma with chemotherapy. The chemotherapy regimen commonly used is called ICE. ICE is a combination of chemotherapy drugs: ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide. The second step of treatment is to give high doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy followed by infusion of stem cells. This is called an ASCT. This study will focus on the first step of treatment for relapsed and refractory HL.\n\nICE chemotherapy can cause many side effects. We believe that there are patients who can receive less toxic treatments and still do well. We have learned from past studies that \\[18F\\]FDG-PET scans (which we will call \"PET scans\") can be used to predict who will do well after ASCT. PET scans are tests used to measure the metabolic activity of the disease. Patients without abnormal activity on their PET scan (negative PET scan) before ASCT are much more likely to be cured than those with activity on their PET scan (positive PET scan).\n\nIn this study, instead of beginning with ICE chemotherapy, the patient will receive a new drug called Brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35). SGN-35 is a type of drug called an antibody drug conjugate. SGN-35 has 2 parts; a part that targets cancer cells (the antibody) and a cell killing part (the chemotherapy). The antibody part of SGN-35 sticks to a target called CD30. CD30 is an important molecule on some cancer cells (including Hodgkin lymphoma) and some normal cells of the immune system. The cell killing part of SGN-35 is a chemotherapy called monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE).\n\nIt can kill cells that the antibody part of SGN-35 sticks to.\n\nCompared to ICE chemotherapy, SGN-has fewer side effects and does not require inpatient admission for treatment. We aim to determine whether patients can avoid treatment with ICE prior to ASCT. We will use the results of the PET scan to determine whether the patient needs additional chemotherapy before ASCT. If the PET scan is negative, the patient will be referred to ASCT and not receive ICE chemotherapy. If the PET scan is positive, the physician will discuss further treatment options with the patient.",

In addition to the ABVD chemotherapy, patients with Hodgkin lymphoma will routinely receive radiation therapy. The use of chemotherapy and radiation may cause long term treatment related side effects such as heart problems and other cancers. Researchers are trying to find if combining ABVD chemotherapy with new drugs and reducing the number of ABVD chemotherapy cycles given is just as effective as the standard Hodgkin treatment.\n\nBrentuximab vedotin is approved by the United States Food and Drug administration (FDA) for the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back (relapsed). For this research study, the use of brentuximab vedotin in newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma is considered investigational. Brentuximab vedotin is an antibody that also has a chemotherapy drug attached to it. Antibodies are proteins that are part of your immune system. They can stick to and attack specific targets on cells. The antibody part of the brentuximab vedotin sticks to a target called cluster of differentiation antigen 30 (CD30). CD30 is an important molecule on some cancer cells and some normal cells of the immune system.\n\nThe purpose of this research study is to see the effects of treatment with fewer cycles of the combination chemotherapy, ABVD, followed by the study drug brentuximab vedotin has on study participants and Hodgkins lymphoma.",

          "Brief Summary": "Brentuximab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate targeting CD30, one of surface antigens expressed in lymphoma cells. Fanale MA, et al. reported the results of a phase I study with weekly dosing of brentuximab vedotin in patients with relapsed/refractory CD30-positive hematologic malignancies (Clin Cancer Res. 2012) showed tumor regression in 85% of patients. Thus, the overall objective response rate was 59% (24/44) including 34% (n = 14) of complete remissions. This study mainly included Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 38) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (n = 5). However, its efficacy in other types of NHL has never been reported although this study enrolled one patient with peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS).\n\nCD30 (TNFRSF8) is a transmembrane glycoprotein of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, and it is involved in signal transduction via the activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), ultimately modulating cell growth, proliferation and apoptosis. CD30 is a non-lineage-specific activation marker expressed by scattered B and T immunoblasts. In addition, a subset of cases in virtually all T-cell lymphoma entities may also express CD30 but at variable and generally lower levels. In fact, a recent study in 22 patients with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma showed 75% of positive rate of CD30 expression (75%). Moreover, CD30 expression was also documented in the tumor sample of EB virus positive diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (EBV + DLBCL) of the elderly (28.9%, 11/38). Therefore, Brentuximab vedotin may have potential benefits for patients with CD30-positive NHL other than anaplastic large cell lymphoma such as CD30-positive PTCLs, NOS. Considering the role of CD30 in signal transduction pathway associated with tumor growth and proliferation, its expression may be associated with tumor aggressiveness. In accordance with this, it is more likely that relapse or refractory NHLs may have CD30 expression, and the potential benefits of this promising agent as a salvage therapy deserve to be further investigated in these patients who have high risk of treatment failure. Thus, we designed a phase II study for relapsed or refractory NHL patients. This study is to explore the safety and activity of dosing once every 3 weeks of Brentuximab vedotin in patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive NHL other than anaplastic large cell lymphoma.",

BV has shown promising results in other CD30 expressing non-hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), including relapsed angio-immunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases (PTLD) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with ORR rates of 50%, 40% and 45%, respectively. Despite expression of CD30 on tumor cells, no objective responses were observed in relapsed primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). Strikingly, thus far correlative studies have not found predictive markers in tissue or blood that are predictive for response to treatment. Since CD30 expression in tumor tissue is unrelated to treatment outcome, this suggests involvement of phenomena like tumor heterogeneity, drug uptake in the tumor micro-environment or very low CD30 expression below the immunohistochemistry (IHC) threshold. In this imaging study the biodistribution of brentuximab will be investigated by using Zirconium-89 (89Zr)-labeled brentuximab. 89Zr-brentuximab imaging will help to assess tumor uptake and pharmacokinetic (PK) and -dynamic properties of brentuximab in patients who are intended to be treated with BV, either in one of the registered indications (HL, CTCL and sALCL) or as part of the HOVON 136 trial for patients with DLBCL. The hypothesize is that the results of this imaging study might be used to facilitate the identification of patients that would benefit most from BV treatment",

Brentuximab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, brentuximab, linked to a toxic agent called vedotin. Brentuximab attaches to CD30 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. Chemotherapy drugs, such as bendamustine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. This trial is being done to determine if the combination of brentuximab vedotin plus bendamustine is safe and to determine the effectiveness of the combination.",

For these reasons, questions arise whether ABVD could be still considered the standard treatment in HL patients aged \\> than 60. Regimens containing other alkylators such as CHOP proved even superior to ABVD, with a 3-y PFS of 67%. Frontline treatment of advanced-stage HL with Brentuximab Vedotin (BV) in association with AVD (Doxorubicin, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine) proved very active in a pioneer study, reporting the preliminary results of a phase 1 multicentre trial, in which the percentage of patients achieving CR was as high as 92%. For all these reason the investigators decided to test the association of an alkylator with an innovative mechanism of action and a very safe toxicity profile in the elderly such as Bendamustine (Be) with BV in untreated elderly HL patients.\n\nThe combination of BV and Be, investigated in this study, might represent an innovative treatment alternative for HL patients older than 60 years of age, especially for those of them in whom ABVD chemotherapy, the current standard front-line treatment, is not suitable. However, even when ABVD is given as upfront treatment for elderly HL patients, it is associated with substantial dose reduction, treatment delay, toxicity, and treatment-related mortality, with treatment outcomes remaining much inferior to those obtained in younger patients. This drug association is expected to be safe, well-tolerated and to demonstrate higher efficiency compared with ABVD. In this setting, it is expected that this therapy could be offered to the large majority of elderly patients with a full treatment completion reached in up to 80% of these patients.\n\nThus, the aim of this study will be to assess safety and efficacy of the above association.",

It also means that the FDA has not approved brentuximab vedotin for the treatment of GVHD.\n\nCurrently, corticosteroids are the standard/first line of treatment for people with GVHD. However, some patients do not achieve a good response with steroids and other experience flare-ups while tapering steroid treatment. Corticosteroid treatment has also led to a weakening of the immune system. For this reason, there have been increased attempts by researchers to find other options for the treatment of Graft vs. Host Disease.\n\nBrentuximab vedotin is a drug that is FDA approved for the treatment of certain types of cancers, like Hodgkin's lymphoma. Recent research studies have found increased levels of protein called CD30 in people with acute GVHD. Brentuximab vedotin is designed to target CD30. Researchers have never tried to target the CD30 molecule for the treatment of GVHD, but results from other research studies show that it could help slow the growth of your disease.\n\nIn this research study, we are trying to determine the safest dose of brentuximab vedotin that can be given to patients with GVHD.",

This study will enroll people who have lymphoma, such as classical Hodgkin lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma including systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or types of primary cutaneous lymphoma.\n\nThis clinical trial uses a drug called SGN-35T. The study drug is in testing and has not been approved for sale. This is the first time SGN-35T will be used in people. The study drug will be given as an infusion through a vein.\n\nThis study will test the safety of SGN-35T in participants with lymphoma. It will also study the side effects of this drug. A side effect is anything a drug does to the body besides treating the disease.\n\nThis study will have three parts. Parts A and B of the study will find out the best dose and dosing schedule for SGN-35T. Part C will use the dose found in parts A and B to find out how safe SGN-35T is and if it works to treat select lymphomas.",

          "Brief Summary": "The purpose of this study is to test whether BV-AVD is an effective treatment in people with early stage, bulky Hodgkin lymphoma that was recently diagnosed and who have not yet received any treatments for their disease.\n\nBV is a type of drug called an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). ADCs are a substance made up of a monoclonal antibody chemically linked to a drug. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to fight infections and other possible harms to the body. The monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain types of cells, including cancer cells. The linked drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells. Researchers think BV may be an effective treatment for this type of cancer because the drug targets cells that have CD30, which play a role in cancer cell growth. By destroying these cells, BV may help slow or stop the growth of the cancer. AVD (doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) is a treatment regimen that works by stopping the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. The researchers think that BV in combination with AVD may work better than AVD alone to slow or stop the growth of the cancer.",

Approximately 30% of patients with breast cancer have HER2 positive breast cancer. Before HER2 targeted therapies (i.e. treatments that directly block the receptor HER2) were developed, patients with HER2 positive breast cancer had a very aggressive form of disease. With the use of trastuzumab, an anticancer drug that directly targets the receptor HER2, and more recently, pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine, patients are able to live longer and have better control of their cancer.\n\nUnfortunately the use of HER2 targeted therapies can increase the risk of heart problems and for this reason these treatments were only studied and approved for patients with normal heart function.\n\nIn this study we plan to give HER2 targeted therapies to patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function along with concomitant evaluation by a heart doctor (called cardiologist) and appropriate medications to strengthen the heart. We will do frequent monitoring of the heart function with a test called echocardiogram that will give us a detailed \"picture\" of the heart. We will also draw blood along with routine blood tests to try to understand why some patients develop heart problems and others do not. The study will take a maximum of 12 months and patients will be monitored for 6 additional months.\n\nWe hypothesize that it is safe to administer HER2 targeted therapies to patients with breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function, i.e. LVEF between 40 and 50%, while on appropriate heart medications.",

          "Brief Summary": "This phase II trial evaluates whether loncastuximab tesirine and rituximab followed by dose-adjusted doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone works to treat patients with high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Loncastuximab tesirine is a monoclonal antibody called loncastuximab, linked to a drug called tesirine. It is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as CD19 receptors, and delivers tesirine to kill them. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs such as doxorubicin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair and may kill cancer cells. Prednisone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It is used to reduce inflammation and lower the body's immune response to help lessen the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. Giving loncastuximab tesirine and rituximab in combination with dose-adjusted doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone may be more effective at treating high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients than standard treatments.",

Monoclonal antibodies, such as brentuximab vedotin, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, prednisone, doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, and dacarbazine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. Giving brentuximab vedotin with combination chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells and reduce the need for radiation therapy.",

          "Brief Summary": "This trial will study two treatment combinations for classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). This trial will find out if these two treatment combinations work to treat cHL. It will also find out what side effects occur. A side effect is anything the drug does besides treating cancer. This study will have three parts (Parts A, B, and C).\n\nThe drugs used in Part A are a combination of targeted anticancer drug (brentuximab vedotin) and three chemotherapy drugs (doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine). These four drugs are called \"A+AVD.\" Participants will be treated with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) following every dose of A+AVD for 6 cycles of treatment (12 doses).\n\nPart A will look at whether the A+AVD drug combination reduces the number of participants who experience the side effect of febrile neutropenia. Febrile neutropenia is a very low white blood cell count and a fever, which can be life threatening.\n\nParts B and C will use drug combination of brentuximab vedotin, plus nivolumab, doxorubicin, and dacarbazine. These four drugs are called \"AN+AD.\" Parts B and C will study how well the drugs work to treat cHL and what side effects they cause.",

The first cycle of pembrolizumab will be administered in combination with brentuximab vedotin (BV) (\"lead-in treatment\").\n\nFollowing lead-in treatment, all participants will undergo interim PET/CT (iPET) as well as fitness testing to help inform participant level of fitness for subsequent lymphoma-directed therapies.\n\nParticipants deemed \"non-fit\" by this assessment will continue 3 additional 6 week cycles of concurrent pembrolizumab and BV (\"induction therapy\", each cycle is 42 days), then continue single-agent pembrolizumab to complete up to 4 additional cycles (i.e., 8 total) of therapy (\"consolidation and maintenance therapy\", Non-Fit cohort). Two additional BV doses will be given as consolidation, at days 1 and 22 of pembrolizumab cycle 5.\n\nThose deemed \"fit\" after lead-in therapy (Fit cohort) will continue pembrolizumab and switch from BV to concurrently-administered combination chemotherapy using doxorubicin (A), vinblastine (V), and dacarbazine (D) for a total of 4 planned AVD cycles (3, 6-week pembrolizumab cycles, \"induction therapy\"). Chemotherapy drugs will be given at standard doses as in ABVD (no bleomycin will be given in this study) on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle (C1AVD), and pembrolizumab dosing will remain every 42 days. Following end-induction PET/CT, pembrolizumab will continue every 42 days for up to 4 cycles in the consolidation/maintenance phase. Two additional BV doses will be given as consolidation, at days 1 and 22 of pembrolizumab cycle 5.",

Inotuzumab ozogamicin is a monoclonal antibody, called inotuzumab, linked to a toxic agent called ozogamicin. Inotuzumab attaches to CD22 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers ozogamicin to kill them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving inotuzumab ozogamicin in combination with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells than with chemotherapy alone in treating patients with recurrent or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",

ADCs are a substance made up of a monoclonal antibody chemically linked to a drug. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to fight infections and other possible harms to the body. The monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain types of cells, including cancer cells. The linked drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells. Researchers think BV may be an effective treatment for this type of cancer because the drug targets cells that have CD30, which play a role in cancer cell growth. By destroying these cells, BV may help slow or stop the growth of the cancer. AVD (doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) is a treatment regimen that works by stopping the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. The researchers think that BV in combination with AVD may work better than AVD alone to slow or stop the growth of the cancer.",

          "Brief Summary": "HER2 positive breast cancer cells have more HER2 receptor (a protein on the surface of cells) than normal breast cells. Approximately 30% of patients with breast cancer have HER2 positive breast cancer. Before HER2 targeted therapies (i.e. treatments that directly block the receptor HER2) were developed, patients with HER2 positive breast cancer had a very aggressive form of disease. With the use of trastuzumab, an anticancer drug that directly targets the receptor HER2, and more recently, pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine, patients are able to live longer and have better control of their cancer.\n\nUnfortunately the use of HER2 targeted therapies can increase the risk of heart problems and for this reason these treatments were only studied and approved for patients with normal heart function.\n\nIn this study we plan to give HER2 targeted therapies to patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function along with concomitant evaluation by a heart doctor (called cardiologist) and appropriate medications to strengthen the heart. We will do frequent monitoring of the heart function with a test called echocardiogram that will give us a detailed \"picture\" of the heart. We will also draw blood along with routine blood tests to try to understand why some patients develop heart problems and others do not. The study will take a maximum of 12 months and patients will be monitored for 6 additional months.\n\nWe hypothesize that it is safe to administer HER2 targeted therapies to patients with breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function, i.e. LVEF between 40 and 50%, while on appropriate heart medications.",

This drug has been used in laboratory experiments and information from these studies suggests that this drug may help to prevent or slow the growth of cancer cells. The main purpose of this study is to find the appropriate dose of Taselisib to be used with other drugs in further clinical studies. This is an open-label, 3+3 dose-escalation phase Ib study to identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose(s) (MTD) and to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Taselisib.

Dose Expansion of the study will further assess safety, tolerability and preliminary anti-tumor activity of mirvetuximab soravtansine. A Dose Expansion phase is planned for Regimen A and Regimen D and will open pending Sponsor decision; participants enrolled in the Dose Expansion phase will receive study treatment at the MTD or RP2D determined during Dose Escalation. For Regimen A, participants in the Dose Expansion phase may be enrolled according to prior exposure to bevacizumab into 3 Dose Expansion Cohorts as follows: 1) Dose Expansion Cohort 1: bevacizumab na\u00efve; 2) Dose Expansion Cohort 2: bevacizumab pretreated; and 3) Dose Expansion Cohort 3: one to three prior treatments, one of which could have been bevacizumab. A triplet Regimen (Regimen E: mirvetuximab soravtansine + bevacizumab + carboplatin) will be opened to evaluate the safety and tolerability and to assess any early signs of activity in participants dosed with the combination regimen. All mirvetuximab soravtansine doses were calculated according to adjusted ideal body weight.",

        "description": "[\"11 DESCRIPTION Enfortumab vedotin-ejfv is a Nectin-4 directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of a fully human anti-Nectin-4 IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody (AGS-22C3) conjugated to the small molecule microtubule disrupting agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a protease-cleavable maleimidocaproyl valine-citrulline (vc) linker (SGD-1006). Conjugation takes place on cysteine residues that comprise the interchain disulfide bonds of the antibody to yield a product with a drug-to-antibody ratio of approximately 3.8:1. The molecular weight is approximately 152 kDa. Figure 1. Structural Formula Approximately 4 molecules of MMAE are attached to each antibody molecule. Enfortumab vedotin-ejfv is produced by chemical conjugation of the antibody and small molecule components. The antibody is produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells and the small molecule components are produced by chemical synthesis. PADCEV (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) for injection is provided as a sterile, preservative-free, white to off-white lyophilized powder in single-dose vials for intravenous use. PADCEV is supplied as a 20 mg per vial and a 30 mg per vial and requires reconstitution with Sterile Water for Injection, USP, (2.3 mL and 3.3 mL, respectively) resulting in a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution with a final concentration of 10 mg/mL [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. After reconstitution, each vial allows the withdrawal of 2 mL (20 mg) and 3 mL (30 mg). Each mL of reconstituted solution contains 10 mg of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv, histidine (1.4 mg), histidine hydrochloride monohydrate (2.31 mg), polysorbate 20 (0.2 mg) and trehalose dihydrate (55 mg) with a pH of 6.0.

          "Brief Summary": "This phase II trial tests how well enfortumab vedotin (EV) and pembrolizumab works in treating patients with bladder cancer of variant histology (a group of less common types of bladder cancer) that have spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). Enfortumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, enfortumab, linked to an anticancer drug called vedotin. Enfortumab attaches to a protein called nectin-4 on cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. It is a type of antibody-drug conjugate. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab may kill more tumor cells in patients with locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer of variant histology.",

It targets CD22, a molecule on the surface of essentially all hairy cell leukemia cells. Moxetumomab pasudotox binds to CD22, goes into the cell, and releases a toxin which kills the cell. In a phase I trial it had activity in relapsed/refractory hairy cell leukemia with safety profile supporting further clinical study (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22355053). This is a phase III multicenter trial designed to confirm these results.",

          "Brief Summary": "HER2 positive breast cancer cells have more HER2 receptor (a protein on the surface of cells) than normal breast cells. Approximately 30% of patients with breast cancer have HER2 positive breast cancer. Before HER2 targeted therapies (i.e. treatments that directly block the receptor HER2) were developed, patients with HER2 positive breast cancer had a very aggressive form of disease. With the use of trastuzumab, an anticancer drug that directly targets the receptor HER2, and more recently, pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine, patients are able to live longer and have better control of their cancer.\n\nUnfortunately the use of HER2 targeted therapies can increase the risk of heart problems and for this reason these treatments were only studied and approved for patients with normal heart function.\n\nIn this study we plan to give HER2 targeted therapies to patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function along with concomitant evaluation by a heart doctor (called cardiologist) and appropriate medications to strengthen the heart. We will do frequent monitoring of the heart function with a test called echocardiogram that will give us a detailed \"picture\" of the heart. We will also draw blood along with routine blood tests to try to understand why some patients develop heart problems and others do not. The study will take a maximum of 12 months and patients will be monitored for 6 additional months.\n\nWe hypothesize that it is safe to administer HER2 targeted therapies to patients with breast cancer and mildly decreased heart function, i.e. LVEF between 40 and 50%, while on appropriate heart medications.",

Taselisib is an investigational drug which works by blocking a protein called PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) that helps cancer cells grow. This drug has been used in laboratory experiments and information from these studies suggests that this drug may help to prevent or slow the growth of cancer cells. The main purpose of this study is to find the appropriate dose of Taselisib to be used with other drugs in further clinical studies. This is an open-label, 3+3 dose-escalation phase Ib study to identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose(s) (MTD) and to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Taselisib. This study will be conducted in 4 separate arms. (A-D).",

ARX788 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that is given by infusion (diluted and injected slowly into veins). Antibodies are proteins which are naturally produced by the body's immune system to help fight infections. ARX788 consists of antibodies that have been attached to a toxin that has the potential to kill cancer cells. ARX788 sticks to a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), which is found on some breast cancer cells. Giving ARX788 may be safe and effective in treating patients with HER2-low locally advanced unresectable metastatic breast cancer.",

TUB-040 is an antibody-drug-conjugate which delivers a topoisomerase I inhibitor to tumor cells which overexpress the target NaPi2b. The study consists of two parts: In dose escalation, ovarian cancer patients and lung cancer patients receive increasing doses of TUB-040 until the maximal tolerated dose is found. In dose optimization, at least two doses are compared with each other to determine which dose is optimal for patients.\n\nTUB-040 is given IV every 3 weeks until the disease progresses or the patient has to stop due to side effects.",

SG3199 attached to the linker is designated as SG3249, also known as tesirine. Loncastuximab tesirine-lpyl has an approximate molecular weight of 151 kDa. An average of 2.3 molecules of SG3249 are attached to each antibody molecule. Loncastuximab tesirine-lpyl is produced by chemical conjugation of the antibody and small molecule components. The antibody is produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, and the small molecule components are produced by chemical synthesis. ZYNLONTA (loncastuximab tesirine-lpyl) for injection is supplied as a sterile, white to off-white, preservative-free, lyophilized powder, which has a cake-like appearance, for intravenous infusion after reconstitution and dilution. Each single-dose vial delivers 10 mg of loncastuximab tesirine-lpyl, L-histidine (2.8 mg), L-histidine monohydrochloride (4.6 mg), polysorbate 20 (0.4 mg), and sucrose (119.8 mg).

Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of three components: 1) a humanized anti-HER2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), covalently linked to 2) a topoisomerase inhibitor, via 3) a tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker. Deruxtecan is composed of a protease-cleavable maleimide tetrapeptide linker and the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd, which is an exatecan derivative. The antibody is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells by recombinant DNA technology, and the topoisomerase inhibitor and linker are produced by chemical synthesis. Approximately 8 molecules of deruxtecan are attached to each antibody molecule. Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki has the following structure: ENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) is a sterile, white to yellowish white, preservative-free lyophilized powder in single-dose vials. Each vial delivers 100 mg of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, L-histidine (4.45 mg), L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate (20.2 mg), polysorbate 80 (1.5 mg), and sucrose (450 mg). Following reconstitution with 5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, the resulting concentration of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is 20 mg/mL with a pH of 5.5. The resulting solution is administered by intravenous infusion following dilution. Chemical Structure\"]",

The recombinant monoclonal antibody is produced by mammalian (murine myeloma) cells, while the small molecule components SN-38 and CL2A are produced by chemical synthesis. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy contains on average 7 to 8 molecules of SN-38 per antibody molecule. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy has a molecular weight of approximately 160 kilodaltons. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy has the following chemical structure. TRODELVY (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy) for injection is a sterile, preservative-free, off-white to yellowish lyophilized powder for intravenous use in a 50 mL clear glass single-dose vial, with a rubber stopper and crimp-sealed with an aluminum flip-off cap. Each single-dose vial of TRODELVY delivers 180 mg sacituzumab govitecan-hziy, 77.3 mg 2-(N-morpholino) ethane sulfonic acid (MES), 1.8 mg polysorbate 80 and 154 mg trehalose dihydrate. Reconstitution with 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, results in a concentration of 10 mg/mL with a pH of 6.5. Chemical Structure\"]",

Emtansine refers to the MCC-DM1 complex. The antibody trastuzumab, is a well characterized recombinant monoclonal antibody product produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, and the small molecule components (DM1 and MCC) are produced by chemical synthesis. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine contains an average of 3.5 DM1 molecules per antibody. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine has the following chemical structure: Note: The bracketed structure is DM1 plus MCC which represents the emtansine component. The n is, on average, 3.5 DM1 molecules per trastuzumab (Mab) molecule. KADCYLA (ado-trastuzumab emtansine) is a sterile, white to off-white preservative free lyophilized powder in single-dose vials. Each vial contains 100 mg or 160 mg ado-trastuzumab emtansine. Following reconstitution, each single-dose vial contains ado-trastuzumab emtansine (20 mg/mL), polysorbate 20 [0.02% (w/v)], sodium succinate (10 mM), and sucrose [6% (w/v)] with a pH of 5.0.

It consists of three components: 1) the humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody specific for human CD79b; 2) the small molecule anti-mitotic agent MMAE; and 3) a protease-cleavable linker maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (mc-vc-PAB) that covalently attaches MMAE to the polatuzumab antibody. Polatuzumab vedotin-piiq has an approximate molecular weight of 150 kDa. An average of 3.5 molecules of MMAE are attached to each antibody molecule. Polatuzumab vedotin-piiq is produced by chemical conjugation of the antibody and small molecule components. The antibody is produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, and the small molecule components are produced by chemical synthesis. POLIVY (polatuzumab vedotin-piiq) for injection is supplied as a sterile, white to grayish-white, preservative-free, lyophilized powder, which has a cake-like appearance, for intravenous infusion after reconstitution and dilution. Each single-dose 30 mg POLIVY vial delivers 30 mg of polatuzumab vedotin-piiq, polysorbate-20 (1.8 mg), sodium hydroxide (0.82 mg), succinic acid (1.77 mg), and sucrose (62 mg). After reconstitution with 1.8 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, the final concentration is 20 mg/mL with a pH of approximately 5.3.

Belantamab mafodotin-blmf is an antibody conjugate composed of 3 components: 1) afucosylated, humanized immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody covalently linked to 2) the microtubule inhibitor MMAF via 3) a protease-resistant maleimidocaproyl linker. The antibody is produced in a mammalian cell line (Chinese Hamster Ovary) using recombinant DNA technology and the microtubule inhibitor and linker are produced by chemical synthesis. Approximately 4 molecules of mafodotin are attached to each antibody molecule. The molecular weight of belantamab mafodotin-blmf is approximately 152 kDa. Belantamab mafodotin-blmf has the following structure: BLENREP (belantamab mafodotin-blmf) for injection is a sterile, preservative-free, white to yellow, lyophilized powder in a single-dose vial for reconstitution and further dilution prior to intravenous use. BLENREP is supplied as 100 mg per vial and requires reconstitution with 2 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, to obtain a concentration of 50 mg/mL . Each mL of reconstituted solution contains belantamab mafodotin-blmf (50 mg) and the inactive ingredients, citric acid (0.42 mg), disodium edetate dihydrate (0.019 mg), polysorbate 80 (0.2 mg), trehalose dihydrate (75.6 mg), and trisodium citrate dihydrate (6.7 mg).

Mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx has an approximate molecular weight of 150 kDa. An average of 3.4 molecules of DM4 are attached to each antibody molecule. Mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx is produced by chemical conjugation of the antibody and small molecule components. The antibody is produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, and the small molecule components are produced by chemical synthesis. Mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx has the following structure: ELAHERE (mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx) injection is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free, clear to slightly opalescent, colorless solution containing 100 mg/20 mL of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx in single-dose vials. Each mL of solution contains 5 mg of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx, and glacial acetic acid (0.22 mg), polysorbate 20 (0.1 mg), sodium acetate (0.53 mg), sucrose (90 mg), and Water for Injection. The pH is approximately 5.0. The ELAHERE vial stoppers are not made with natural rubber latex. Chemical Structure\"]",

DESCRIPTION Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of the CD33-directed monoclonal antibody (hP67.6; recombinant humanized immunoglobulin [Ig] G4, kappa antibody produced by mammalian cell culture in NS0 cells) that is covalently linked to the cytotoxic agent N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin consists of conjugated and unconjugated gemtuzumab. The conjugated molecules differ in the number of activated calicheamicin derivative moieties attached to gemtuzumab. The number of conjugated calicheamicin derivatives per gemtuzumab molecule ranges from predominantly zero to 6, with an average of 2 to 3 moles of calicheamicin derivative per mole of gemtuzumab. MYLOTARG (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) for injection is supplied as a sterile, white to off-white, preservative-free lyophilized cake or powder for intravenous administration. Each single-dose vial delivers 4.5 mg gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Inactive ingredients are dextran 40 (41.0 mg), sodium chloride (26.1 mg), sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous (2.7 mg), sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate (0.45 mg), and sucrose (69.8 mg). After reconstitution with 5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection USP, the concentration is 1 mg/mL of gemtuzumab ozogamicin with a deliverable volume of 4.5 mL (4.5 mg). Chemical Structure\"]",

DESCRIPTION Inotuzumab ozogamicin is a CD22-directed antibody and cytotoxic-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of 3 components: 1) the recombinant humanized immunoglobulin class G subtype 4 (IgG4) kappa antibody inotuzumab, specific for human CD22, 2) N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin that causes double-stranded DNA breaks, and 3) an acid-cleavable linker composed of the condensation product of 4-(4'-acetylphenoxy)-butanoic acid (AcBut) and 3-methyl-3-mercaptobutane hydrazide (known as dimethylhydrazide) that covalently attaches N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin to inotuzumab. Inotuzumab ozogamicin has an approximate molecular weight of 160 kDa. The average number of calicheamicin derivative molecules conjugated to each inotuzumab molecule is approximately 6 with a distribution from 2\u20138. Inotuzumab ozogamicin is produced by chemical conjugation of the antibody and small molecule components. The antibody is produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, and the semisynthetic calicheamicin derivative is produced by microbial fermentation followed by synthetic modification. BESPONSA (inotuzumab ozogamicin) for injection is supplied as a sterile, white to off-white, preservative-free, lyophilized powder for intravenous administration. Each single-dose vial delivers 0.9 mg inotuzumab ozogamicin. Inactive ingredients are polysorbate 80 (0.36 mg), sodium chloride (2.16 mg), sucrose (180 mg), and tromethamine (8.64 mg). After reconstitution with 4 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, the final concentration is 0.25 mg/mL of inotuzumab ozogamicin with a deliverable volume of 3.6 mL (0.9 mg) and a pH of approximately 8.0.

DESCRIPTION Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of the CD33-directed monoclonal antibody (hP67.6; recombinant humanized immunoglobulin [Ig] G4, kappa antibody produced by mammalian cell culture in NS0 cells) that is covalently linked to the cytotoxic agent N-acetyl gamma calicheamicin. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin consists of conjugated and unconjugated gemtuzumab. The conjugated molecules differ in the number of activated calicheamicin derivative moieties attached to gemtuzumab. The number of conjugated calicheamicin derivatives per gemtuzumab molecule ranges from predominantly zero to 6, with an average of 2 to 3 moles of calicheamicin derivative per mole of gemtuzumab. MYLOTARG (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) for injection is supplied as a sterile, white to off-white, preservative-free lyophilized cake or powder for intravenous administration. Each single-dose vial delivers 4.5 mg gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Inactive ingredients are dextran 40 (41.0 mg), sodium chloride (26.1 mg), sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous (2.7 mg), sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate (0.45 mg), and sucrose (69.8 mg). After reconstitution with 5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection USP, the concentration is 1 mg/mL of gemtuzumab ozogamicin with a deliverable volume of 4.5 mL (4.5 mg). Chemical Structure\"]",

DESCRIPTION Inotuzumab ozogamicin is a CD22-directed antibody and cytotoxic-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of 3 components: 1) the recombinant humanized immunoglobulin class G subtype 4 (IgG4) kappa antibody inotuzumab, specific for human CD22, 2) N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin that causes double-stranded DNA breaks, and 3) an acid-cleavable linker composed of the condensation product of 4-(4'-acetylphenoxy)-butanoic acid (AcBut) and 3-methyl-3-mercaptobutane hydrazide (known as dimethylhydrazide) that covalently attaches N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin to inotuzumab. Inotuzumab ozogamicin has an approximate molecular weight of 160 kDa. The average number of calicheamicin derivative molecules conjugated to each inotuzumab molecule is approximately 6 with a distribution from 2\u20138. Inotuzumab ozogamicin is produced by chemical conjugation of the antibody and small molecule components. The antibody is produced by mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, and the semisynthetic calicheamicin derivative is produced by microbial fermentation followed by synthetic modification. BESPONSA (inotuzumab ozogamicin) for injection is supplied as a sterile, white to off-white, preservative-free, lyophilized powder for intravenous administration. Each single-dose vial delivers 0.9 mg inotuzumab ozogamicin. Inactive ingredients are polysorbate 80 (0.36 mg), sodium chloride (2.16 mg), sucrose (180 mg), and tromethamine (8.64 mg). After reconstitution with 4 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, the final concentration is 0.25 mg/mL of inotuzumab ozogamicin with a deliverable volume of 3.6 mL (0.9 mg) and a pH of approximately 8.0.

Participants will need to attend an MRI scan at the Sunshine Coast University Hospital within one week prior to their standard radiotherapy planning CT. This scan will be performed with the participant lying in the radiation therapy treatment position with a custom fit immobilisation mask in place and may take up to an hour to perform.   Based on the quantitative information from this scan, a high-risk volume within the tumour will be identified. A boost dose of 5-7Gy in one fraction will be delivered to this tumour subvolume defined by an area of low apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, representative of increased cellular density. This is followed by a 3-5 day break then the standard fractionated radiation therapy schedule of 66-70Gy over 6-7 weeks is delivered. Each individual treatment takes approximately 15 minutes.  The study will be conducted by the Radiation Oncology department at the Sunshine Coast University Hospital in Birtinya, Queensland. The participant will be asked to complete quality of life questionnaires at 5 different timepoints before, during and after the treatment period. These questionnaires may take up to 5mins to complete each time. Patients will be monitored closely by the treating team for any acute or late treatment side effects."

This additional priming will be performed before the circuit is connected to the patient. The study will also determine if there is a difference between regional citrate and global heparinised anticoagulation on circuit life.  The dose of citrate (in the form of ADC-A) will be titrated with a calcium chloride infusion to maintain circuit calciums of less than 0.3 mmol/L and a patient calcium of 1.0-1.3 mmol/L. Upon recruitment all participants will be randomly assigned to one of 8 sequences of varying anticoagulation and priming methods as recommended for a four period crossover design with 2 factorial treatments.  Their first 4 circuits will consist of two heparin and two citrate circuits, one of each will be primed with heparinised saline and the other with an additional heparinised albumin prime, with the order of the treatments determined by their pre-assigned randomised sequence. As hemofiltration is necessary to maintain these patients there will be no intentional \"wash out\" period as with holding treatment may be detrimental to the patient. Each circuit will run until TMP (Transmembrane Pressure) reaches 280mmHg, treatment needs to be interrupted for longer than two hours or a significant adverse event occured.  The participant will be in the trial for a maximum of eight circuits."
